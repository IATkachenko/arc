SLCS Service and SLCS client. This feature needs the external Identity Provider
for authenticating the users.
Now there is a test Identity Provider hosted in squark.uio.no.
When running arcslcs (SLCS client), the idp name "https://squark.uio.no/idp/shibboleth"
needs to be specified.
As result, a short-lived X.509 Credential will be generated.

HTTP MCC now supports streaming. As result HTTP services based on MCC
like A-REX and HOPI should handle upload of big files efficiently enough.
It should be possible to stage in big input files to A-REX direcly from
client. - THIS FEATURE IS NOW TESTED WITH HOPI SERVICE
