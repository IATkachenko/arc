ARC Middleware
==============

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware, introduced by the
NorduGrid Collaboration (www.nordugrid.org), is an open source software
solution enabling production quality computational and data grids.

Since its first release (May 2002) the middleware has been deployed and
been used in production environments. Emphasis is put on scalability,
stability, reliability and performance of the middleware. A growing
number of grid projects, like Swegrid, NDGF and Swiss Bio Grid have
chosen ARC as their middleware.

This release (April 2011) is the first release of the new generation of
ARC (previews were known as ARC1 or Nox). It is based on a service
container - the Hosting Environment Daemon (HED) - and different grid
capabilities are implemented as Web Services residing in HED. ARC Compute
Element is implemented as an OGSA BES compliant execution service called
A-REX (ARC Resource-coupled EXecution service), which has same
functionality as Grid Manager before. Another service residing in HED
and included in this release is a simple echo service for test purposes,
but the set of services is rapidly growing.



Dependencies
============

The core part of middleware is written in C/C++.
Building the software from source or installing a precompiled binary 
requires different external packages, furthermore the client and server
packages have different dependencies too. Below a list of the explicit 
requirements is shown:

Please note that depending on operating system distribution to build
ARC you may need to install development versions of mentioned packages.



Getting the software
====================

The middleware is free to deploy anywhere by anybody. Pre-built binary
releases for a dozen of Linux platforms can be downloaded from the
NorduGrid software repository at download.nordugrid.org.

The software is released under the Apache 2.0 License (see the LICENSE
file).

The NorduGrid repository hosts the source code, and provides most of
the required external software which are not part of a standard Linux
distribution.

You can get the latest source code for ARC from the Subversion 
repository. See http://svn.nordugrid.org for more details.

There are also nightly code snapshots available at
http://download.nordugrid.org/software/nordugrid-arc/experimental/ .
Choose latest version available, go in to the src directory and
download the tarball.



Building & Installation
=======================

The recommended way to install ARC is from repositories.  If you want
to build it yourself and downloaded the tarball, unpack it and cd into
the created directory.

  tar -zxvf nordugrid-arc-1.0.0.tar.gz
  cd nordugrid-arc-1.0.0

If you obtained the code from the Subversion repository, use the
'tags/1.0.0' directory.
  svn co http://svn.nordugrid.org/repos/nordugrid/arc1/tags/1.0.0 nordugrid-arc
  cd nordugrid-arc

Now configure the obtained code with

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=PLACE_TO_INSTALL_ARC

Choose the installation prefix wisely and according to the
requirements of your OS and personal preferences. ARC should function
properly from any location. By default installation goes into /usr if
you omit the '--prefix' option. If you instal into another directory
than /usr you may need to set up the environment variable after
installation:

  export ARC_LOCATION=PLACE_TO_INSTALL_ARC

On some systems 'autogen.sh' may produce few warnings. Ignore them as 
long as 'configure' passes without errors. But in case of problems 
during configure or compilation, collect them and present while 
reporting problems.

If the previous commands finish without errors, do

  touch src/doxygen/*.pdf

in order to get around an issue with timestamps and then compile and
install ARC:

  make
  make install

If you have already installed ARC libraries in the system default
location such as /usr/lib you may need to use the following
installation command instead in order to override installed pkgconfig
files and/or libtool archives which contains -L/usr/lib:

  make LDFLAGS="-L<PLACE_TO_INSTALL_ARC>/lib" install

On some systems you may need to use gmake instead of make.

Depending on chosen installation location you may need to run the last
command from root account. That should install the following components:

sbin/arched - server executable
bin/ - user tools and command line clients
lib/ - common libraries used by clients, server and plugins
lib/arc/ - plugins implementing Message Chain, Service and Security components
include/arc/ - C++ headers for application development
libexec/ - additional modules used by ARC services - currently only A-REX
share/arc - configuration examples, templates etc
share/doc/nordugrid-arc-* - documentation
share/locale - internationalization files - curently very limited support
share/man - manual pages for various utilities



X509 Certificates
=================

Most of ARC planned and existing services use HTTPS as transport protocol
so they require proper setup of X509 security infrastructure. Minimal 
requirements are:
* Host certificate aka public key in PEM format
* Corresponding private key
* Certificate of the Certification Authority (CA) which was used to sign the host certificate
* Certificates of CAs of clients which are going to send requests to services. Unless
of course clients use the same CA as the server.

More information about X509 certificates and their usage in Grid environment 
can be found on http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/certificate_howto.html
and http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/ng-server-install.html#security

For testing purposes you can use pre-generated certificates and
keys available at:

 http://svn.nordugrid.org/trac/nordugrid/browser/doc/trunk/tech_doc/sec/TestCA

Alternatively You may choose to use KnowARC Instant CA service available at 
https://vls.grid.upjs.sk/CA/instantCA . It is especially useful if to test
installations consisting on multiple hosts.

Please remember that it is not safe to use such instant keys in publicly
accessible installations of ARC. Make sure that even the generate CA
certificate is removed before making your services available to the
outside world.

You can put host certificates and private keys anywhere. Common locations
for servers running from root account are /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
and /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem, respectively. The content of the
private key must not be encrypted and or protected by a password sinc
a service has no way to ask person about password. So make sure it is
properly protected by means of file system.

It is possible to configure ARC server to accept either a single CA certificate
or multiple CA certificates located in the specified directory. The latter
option is recommended. The common location is /etc/grid-security/certificates/ .
In that case names of certificate files have to follow hash values of
the certificates. These are obtainable by running the command

  openssl x509 -hash -noout -in path_to_certificate

The corresponding file name for the certificate should be <hash_value>.0 . 
The value for the pre-generated CA certificate is 4457e417. 

1. Configuration for mutual authentication
Please make sure the chosen location of certificates is correctly
configured in the service configuration file. The configuration for the
certificate for TLS MCC should look like this:  

      <KeyPath>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</KeyPath>
      <CertificatePath>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</CertificatePath>
      <CACertificatesDir>/etc/grid-security/certificates</CACertificatesDir>

or

      <CACertificatePath>/etc/grid-security/ca.pem</CACertificatePath>

The key file has to be without passphrase for the server side. You can also 
configure a proxy certificate instead of the normal certificate (See part:
Proxy certificate Generation & Usage).

The same requirements are valid for the client tools of ARC. You may use
the pregenerated user certificate and key located at the same
place. Locations of the credentials are provided to the client tools
from the command line.

2.Configuration for no client-authentication
You can also configure only server-authentication instead of mutual 
authentication. In this case, the server will not send a client certificate 
request to the client, so the client will not send a certificate to the 
server, which means only the server's certificate is checked.

For the server side, the configuration for the certificate for TLS MCC 
should look like this:
      <KeyPath>/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</KeyPath>
      <CertificatePath>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</CertificatePath>
      <ClientAuthn>false</ClientAuthn>
Note: here either <CACertificatePath/> or <<CACertificatesDir>/> are not needed,
because the client's certificate will not checked by server; but <ClientAuthn/>
is required here, which explicitly specify that client's certificate will not 
be checked, the default value of <ClientAuthn/> is "true" and it does not need 
to be explicitly specified.

For the client side, the configuration for the certificate for TLS MCC 
should look like this:
      <CACertificatesDir>/etc/grid-security/certificates</CACertificatesDir>
or
      <CACertificatePath>/etc/grid-security/ca.pem</CACertificatePath>
Note: here only the ca information needs to be specified.




The set of pre-generated keys and certificates also includes a user
certificate in PKCS12 format which you can import into your browser
for accessing ARC services capable of producing HTML output.

ARC comes with the utility arcproxy to generate proxy credentials
from a certificate/private key pair. It provides only basic functionality 
and is meant for testing purposes only. 

IMPORTANT: If during configuration stage You see a message "OpenSSL 
contains no support for proxy credentials" that means You won't be
able to use proxy credentials generated by utilities like grid-proxy-init,
voms-proxy-init or arcproxy. Because of that all user private keys has 
to be kept unencrypted. 



Proxy certificate Generation & Usage
====================================
As metioned above, ARC comes with utility proxy generation utility
--arcproxy. 
arcproxy appears in ARC_LOCATION/bin. The usage of arcproxy is like:
ARC_LOCATION/bin/arcproxy -P proxy.pem -C cert.pem -K key.pem 
-c validityStart=2008-05-29T10:20:30Z
-c validityEnd=2008-06-29T10:20:30Z
-c proxyPolicyFile=delegation_policy.xml
By using argument "-c", some constraints can be specified for proxy 
certificate. 
Currently, the life time can be specified by using 
"-c validityStart=..." and "-c validityEnd=...", or "-c validityStart=..."
and "-c validityPeriod=..."; 
and the proxy policy can be specified by using "-c proxyPolicyFile=..." 
or "-c proxyPolicy=...".
Note: If the "validityStart" has not been set, the current time will 
be used as start time for proxy. 
If both "validityEnd" and "validityPeriod" have not been set, the default
validity period will be set to 12 hours.
If the "validityStart" is set, it should not be before current time.
The time unit for "validityPeriod" is second, e.g. "-c validityPeriod=86400"

If proxy certificate is used, in the configuration file for service
side or client side, the configuration for the certificate for TLS MCC 
should look like this:
      <KeyPath>./proxy.pem</KeyPath>
      <CertificatePath>./proxy.pem</CertificatePath>
      <CACertificatePath>./ca.pem</CACertificatePath>
Since normally a proxy certificate file includes the proxy certificate
and private key corresponding to the proxy certificate, <KeyPath/> and 
<CertificatePath/> are configured the same.

Alternatively, you can directly configure <ProxyPath/> instead of <KeyPath/>
and <CertificatePath/>:
      <ProxyPath>./proxy.pem</ProxyPath>
      <CACertificatePath>./ca.pem</CACertificatePath>


Proxy policy can be spefified as constraint. Proxy policy is for constraining 
identity delegation. Currently, the supported policy is Arc specific policy.
Proxy policy is inserted into proxy certificate's "proxy cert info"
extenstion in RFC3820's policy language "NID_id_ppl_anyLanguage".



ARC Server Setup & Configuration
================================

The configuration of the ARC server can either be specified in
arc.conf or in an XML file, the location of which is specified as a
command line argument with the -c option of 'arched' daemon. Examples
of configuration files with comments describing various elements are
available in directory share/doc/arc of the ARC installation.



The Echo Service
================

The echo service is "atomic" and has no additional dependencies other
than what is provided by the Hosting Environment Daemon (HED). An example
of an echo service configuration can be found in share/doc/arc/echo.xml.



The Echo Client
===============

The configuration of the ARC echo client is specified in an XML
file. The location of the configuration file is specified by the
environment variable ARC_ECHO_CONFIG. If there is no such environment
variable, the configuration file is assumed to be echo_client.xml in
the current working directory. An example configuration file can be
found in share/doc/arc/echo_client.xml

To use the echo client, type

  $ARC_LOCATION/bin/arcecho <message>

where <message> is the message which the echo service will return.



The A-REX Service
=================

ARC comes with OGSA BES compliant Grid job management service called A-REX.
To deploy A-REX use example configuration files available in share/doc/arc :

 * arex.xml - configuration for arched server. Read comments inside this file
   and edit it to fit your installation. This file defines the WS interface of A-REX.
 * arc-arex.conf - legacy configuration for the Grid Manager part of A-REX. This
   file defines how jobs are managed by A-REX locally. Read and edit it. For more
   detailed information please read Grid Manager documentation available in SVN
   repository
   http://svn.nordugrid.org/trac/nordugrid/browser/doc/trunk/tech_doc/a-rex/arex_tech_doc.pdf?format=raw

The Grid Manager runs as part of the A-REX service. There is no need to run any additional
executable. But you still need to setup its infrastructure as long as you are 
going to have anything more sophisticated than described in the example configuration.
For more information read the previously mentioned document.

A-REX uses either GridFTP or HTTPS as transport protocol (although You can reconfigure it to use 
plain HTTP) so it requires proper setup of X509 security infrastructure. See
above for instructions.

Copy example configuration files to some location and edit them. Make sure all paths
to X509 certificates and Grid Manager configuration are set correctly. Start server 
with command

  $ARC_LOCATION/sbin/arched -c path_to_edited_arex.xml
  or
  /etc/init.d/a-rex start

Look into log file specified in arex.xml for possible errors. You can safely ignore 
messages like "Not a '...' type plugin" and "Unknown element ... - ignoring".

If you compiled ARC with Globus support and you see complaints about "libglobus..." 
and that it cannot open a shared object file, try to add "/opt/globus/lib" to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/globus/lib



Testing and Using A-REX (clients)
=================================

Now you may use the command line utility 'arcinfo' to obtain a service description.
You can do something like

 ./arcinfo -c ARC1:https://localhost:60000/arex -l

This should produce a description list of the resources A-REX represents. Below
you can see an example of proper output.

Please note that you can run similar arcinfo request against any ARC service
except for the echo service.

A-REX accepts jobs described in JSDL. Example JSDL jobs are provided
in $ARC_LOCATION/share/doc/ in files 'jsdl_simple.xml' and 'jsdl_stage.xml'. To 
submit job to the A-REX service one may use the 'arcsub' command:

$ARC_LOCATION/bin/arcsub -c ARC1:https://localhost:60000/arex -f /usr/local/share/doc/arc/jsdl_simple.xml -j id.xml

If everything goes fine, somewhere in its output there should be a message
"Job submitted!", and a job identifier is obtained which will be stored
in 'id.xml' file. One can then query job state with the 'arcstat' utility:

 $ARC_LOCATION/bin/arcstat id.xml
 Job status: Running/Submitting

 $ARC_LOCATION/bin/arcstat id.xml
 Job status: Running/Finishing

 $ARC_LOCATION/bin/arcstat id.xml
 Job status: Finished/Finished

Some of the of A-REX client tools consists of arcsub, arcstat, arckill, arcget 
and arcclean commands. For more information please see the man pages of those utilities.


Security and Authorization
==========================

ARC implements security related features through set of Security Handler and 
Policy Decision Point components. Security Handler components are attached to 
message processing components. Each Security Handler takes care of processing
own part of security information. Currently ARC comes with 2 Security Handlers:

 * identity.map - associates client's identity with local (UNIX) identity. It 
   uses PDP components to choose local isentity and/or identity mapping algorithm.
 * arc.authz - calls PDP components and combines obtained authorization
   decisions.
 * delegation.collector - parses proxy policy from remote proxy certificate.
   this Security Handler should be configured under tls mcc component.
 * usernametoken.handler - implement the functioanlity ofws-security usernametoken 
   profile. It will generate usernametoken into soap header, or extract
   usernametoken outof soap header and do authentication based on the
   extracted usernametoken.

Among available PDP components there are

 * allow - always returns positive result
 * deny - always returns negative result 
 * simplelist.pdp - compares DN of user to those stored in a file.
 * arc.pdp - compares request information parsed from message and policy 
   information specified in this pdp.
 * pdpservice.invoker -  it composes the request, puts request into soap message,
   and invokes the remote pdp service to get the response soap which
   includes authorization decision. the pdp service has similar
   functionality with arc.pdp.
 * delegation.pdp - compares request information parsed from message and policy
   information specified in proxy certificate from remote side.

There are examples of A-REX service and echo service with Security Handlers being used.
They may be found at $ARC_LOCATION/share/doc/arc/arex_secure.xml and 
$ARC_LOCATION/share/doc/arc/echo.xml

There is also a pdp service which implements the same functionality as arc.pdp. See 
src/service/pdp/README.
Specifically for arc.pdp and pdp service, a formatted policy with specific schema
should be managed, see $ARC_LOCATION/share/doc/arc/pdp_policy.xml.example and 
$ARC_LOCATION/share/doc/arc/Policy.xsd for details.

For usernametoken handler, there is example about configuration on service side in 
$ARC_LOCATION/share/doc/arc/echo.xml, you can run the echo service by using this configuration
file with usernametoken sechandler configuered. For the client side, the echo client

Contributing
============

The open source development of the ARC middleware is coordinated by
the NorduGrid Collaboration. Currently, the main contributor is the
EMI project (www.eu-emi.eu), but the collaboration is open to new
members. Contributions from the community to the software and the
documentation is welcomed. Sources can be downloaded from the software
repository at download.nordugrid.org or the Subversion code repository at
svn.nordugrid.org.

The technical coordination group defines outstanding issues that have
to be addressed in the framework of the ARC development. Feature
requests and enhancement proposals are recorded in the Bugzilla bug
tracking system at bugzilla.nordugrid.org. For a more detailed
description, write access to the code repository and further
questions, write to the nordugrid-discuss mailing list (see
www.nordugrid.org for details). Ongoing and completed Grid Research
projects and student assignments related to the middleware are listed
on the NorduGrid Web site as well.



Support, documentation, mailing lists, contact
==============================================

User support and site installation assistance is provided via the
request tracking system available at nordugrid-support@nordugrid.org.
In addition, the NorduGrid runs several mailing lists, among which the
nordugrid-discuss mailing list is a general forum for all kind of
issues related to the ARC middleware. The Bugzilla problem tracking system
(bugzilla.nordugrid.org) accepts requests for features or enhancements,
and is the prime medium to track and report problems.

Research papers, overview talks, reference manuals, user guides,
installation instructions, conference presentations, FAQ and even
tutorial materials can be fetched from the documentation section of
www.nordugrid.org

Contact information is kept updated on the www.nordugrid.org web site.
