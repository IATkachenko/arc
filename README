ARC Middleware
==============

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware, introduced by the
NorduGrid Collaboration (www.nordugrid.org), is an open source software
solution enabling production quality computational and data grids.

Since its first release (May 2002) the middleware has been deployed and
been used in production environments. Emphasis is put on scalability,
stability, reliability and performance of the middleware. A growing
number of grid projects, like Swegrid, NDGF and Swiss Bio Grid have
chosen ARC as their middleware.


Dependencies
============

The core part of middleware is written in C/C++.
Building the software from source or installing a pre-compiled binary 
requires different external packages, furthermore the client and server
packages have different dependencies too. Below a list of the explicit 
requirements is shown:

Please note that depending on operating system distribution to build
ARC you may need to install development versions of mentioned packages.



Getting the software
====================

The middleware is free to deploy anywhere by anybody. Pre-built binary
releases for many Linux platforms can be downloaded from the NorduGrid
software repository at download.nordugrid.org.

The software is released under the Apache 2.0 License (see the LICENSE
file).

The NorduGrid repository hosts the source code. The external software
required is usually part of standard Linux distributions.

You can get the latest source code for ARC from the Subversion 
repository. See http://svn.nordugrid.org for more details.

There are also nightly code snapshots available at
http://download.nordugrid.org/nightlies/packages/nordugrid-arc/trunk/ .
Choose latest version available, go in to the src directory and
download the tarball.



Building & Installation
=======================

The recommended way to install ARC is from repositories.  If you want
to build it yourself and downloaded the tarball, unpack it and cd into
the created directory.

  tar -zxvf nordugrid-arc-1.0.0.tar.gz
  cd nordugrid-arc-1.0.0

If you obtained the code from the Subversion repository, use the
'tags/1.0.0' directory.
  svn co http://svn.nordugrid.org/repos/nordugrid/arc1/tags/1.0.0 nordugrid-arc
  cd nordugrid-arc

Now configure the obtained code with

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=PLACE_TO_INSTALL_ARC

Choose the installation prefix wisely and according to the
requirements of your OS and personal preferences. ARC should function
properly from any location. By default installation goes into /usr/local if
you omit the '--prefix' option. If you install into another directory
than /usr/local you may need to set up an environment variable after
installation:

  export ARC_LOCATION=PLACE_TO_INSTALL_ARC

On some systems 'autogen.sh' may produce few warnings. Ignore them as 
long as 'configure' passes without errors. But in case of problems 
during configure or compilation, collect them and present while 
reporting problems.

If the previous commands finish without errors, do

  touch src/doxygen/*.pdf

in order to get around an issue with timestamps and then compile and
install ARC:

  make
  make install

If you have already installed ARC libraries in the system default
location such as /usr/lib you may need to use the following
installation command instead in order to override installed pkgconfig
files and/or libtool archives which contain -L/usr/lib:

  make LDFLAGS="-L<PLACE_TO_INSTALL_ARC>/lib" install

On some systems you may need to use gmake instead of make.

Depending on the chosen installation location you may need to run the last
command from a root account. That should install the following components:

sbin/arched - server executable
etc/init.d - daemon init scripts
bin/ - user tools and command line clients
lib/ - common libraries used by clients, server and plugins
lib/arc/ - plugins implementing Message Chain, Service and Security components
include/arc/ - C++ headers for application development
libexec/ - additional modules used by ARC services - currently only A-REX
share/arc - configuration examples, templates etc
share/doc/nordugrid-arc-* - documentation
share/locale - internationalization files - curently very limited support
share/man - manual pages for various utilities



X509 Certificates
=================

All ARC services use HTTPS or GridFTP as transport protocol so they require
proper setup of an X509 security infrastructure. Minimal requirements are:
* Host certificate aka public key in PEM format
* Corresponding private key
* Certificate of the Certification Authority (CA) which was used to sign the
  host certificate
* Certificates of CAs of clients which are going to send requests to services,
  unless of course clients use the same CA as the server.

More information about X509 certificates and their usage in Grid environment 
can be found on http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/certificate_howto.html
and http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-server-install.html#security

For testing purposes you can use pre-generated certificates and
keys available at:

 http://svn.nordugrid.org/trac/nordugrid/browser/doc/trunk/tech_doc/sec/TestCA

Alternatively You may choose to use KnowARC Instant CA service available at 
https://arc-emi.grid.upjs.sk/instantCA/instantCA . It is especially useful when
testing installations consisting of multiple hosts.

Please remember that it is not safe to use such instant keys in publicly
accessible installations of ARC. Make sure that even the generated CA
certificate is removed before making your services available to the
outside world.

You can put host certificates and private keys anywhere. Common locations
for servers running from root account are /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
and /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem, respectively. The content of the
private key must not be encrypted nor protected by a password since
a service has no way to ask a password. Therefore it must be properly protected
by means of file system permissions (some services enforce that the private key
is only readable by the user running the service).

It is possible to configure the ARC server to accept either a single CA
certificate or multiple CA certificates located in the specified directory. The
latter option is recommended. The common location is
/etc/grid-security/certificates/ . In that case the names of the certificate
files have to follow the hash values of the certificates. These are obtainable
by running the command

  openssl x509 -hash -noout -in path_to_certificate

The corresponding file name for the certificate should be <hash_value>.0 . 
The value for the pre-generated CA certificate is 4457e417. 

For the ARC client tools you may use the pre-generated user certificate and key
located at the same place above. Generally the key and certificate are not used
directly but a passphraseless proxy certificate is generated and used instead.
ARC comes with a proxy generation utility arcproxy - see 'man arcproxy' for
usage and options. Locations of the credentials are provided to the client
tools via the client configuration file.

The set of pre-generated keys and certificates also includes a user
certificate in PKCS12 format which you can import into your browser
for accessing ARC services capable of producing HTML output.

IMPORTANT: If during the configuration stage you see a message "OpenSSL 
contains no support for proxy credentials" that means you won't be
able to use proxy credentials generated by utilities like grid-proxy-init,
voms-proxy-init or arcproxy. Because of that all user private keys must
be kept unencrypted. 



ARC Server Setup & Configuration
================================

The configuration of the ARC server is specified in a file which by default
is at /etc/arc.conf. A different location can be specified by the ARC_CONFIG
environment variable. For configuration details and examples please refer to
the reference in share/arc/arc.conf.reference or the service manual of the
particular services you wish to run.



The A-REX Service
=================

ARC comes with an OGSA BES compliant Grid job management service called A-REX.
To deploy A-REX refer to "ARC Computing Element: System Administrator Guide"
(NORDUGRID-MANUAL-20) which contains extensive information on set up and
configuration of A-REX.



Testing and Using A-REX (clients)
=================================

Now you may use the command line utility 'arcinfo' to obtain a service description.
You can do something like

 arcinfo -c https://localhost:60000/arex -l

This should produce a description list of the resources A-REX represents. Below
you can see a truncated example of proper output.

A-REX accepts jobs described in XRSL, which is described in "Extended Resource
Specification Language: Reference Manual for ARC versions 0.8 and above"
(NORDUGRID-MANUAL-4). To submit a job to the A-REX service one may use the
'arcsub' command:

arcsub -c https://localhost:60000/arex -f simple.xrsl

If everything goes fine, somewhere in its output there should be a message
"Job submitted", and a job identifier is obtained which will be stored locally
in a client job store. One can then query job state with the 'arcstat' utility:

 arcstat <job id>
 State: Running

 arcstat <job id>
 State: Finished

For more information on these and other arc* job and data management commands
please see the man pages of those utilities or "ARC Clients: User Manual for
ARC 11.05 (client versions 1.0.0) and above" (NORDUGRID-MANUAL-13).
