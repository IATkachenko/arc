This branch is dedicated to the cleanup of obsoleted technology. 

As several developers are expected to work on this, a central development branch has been created. 
You can commit by direct push. 

Please keep the branch up to date with master following the usual procedures for a development branch

Once the work is done the branch will be merged back into master, and also into the "next" branch. 

This file should be removed before merging into master. 


Obsoleted technology that should be removed from ARC 6 as part of the code cleanup:

  * CREAM related plugins and server-side components
  * UNICORE related plugins and server-side components
  * all the windows & solaris code and build
  * JAVA bindings
  * BES, WSRF  and other non-EMIES WS flavours
  * JDL, ARCJSDL, RSL job description dialect, we keep only XRSL and ADL

  * EGIIS sever-side (aka infosys registrations to EGIS) BUT: keep EGIS in the client
