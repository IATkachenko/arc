Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, nordugrid-arc1-server, nordugrid-arc1-client
Description: ARC grid middleware
 The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources together
 across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly referred to as 
 a "computational grid". Historically grids address the organisation of
 distributed storage of data and parallel computation, but arbitrary services
 are thinkable.
 .
 Just like the web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was
 erected for analysis the experiments for high energy physics at CERN. The
 first release, ARC-0.x, was dependent on Globus, the current release keeps
 that compatibility but can also be used independently.
