Description: ARC Grid middleware
 NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
 support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
 Connector (ARC).
 .
 The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) is a software suite that makes
 use of Grid technologies to federate heterogeneous computing and data
 resources across administrative domains. The resulting infrastructure
 is commonly referred to as a computational or a data Grid, depending
 on prevalence of CPU-intensive or data-intensive applications. ARC is
 developed and supported by the NorduGrid Consortium.
 .
 Just like the Web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was
 erected to analyze data collected by high energy physics experiments
 at CERN. While first versions of ARC made heavy use of the Globus
 Toolkit, the current release does not require Globus as such, though
 maintains backward compatibility.
