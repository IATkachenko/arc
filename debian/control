Description: ARC grid middleware
 The NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance
 and support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced
 Resource Connector (ARC).
 .
 The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources together
 across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly referred to as 
 a "computational grid". Historically, grids address the organisation of
 distributed storage of data and parallel computation, but arbitrary services
 are thinkable.
 .
 Just like the web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was
 erected to analyse the experiments for high energy physics at CERN. The
 first release, ARC-0.x, was dependent on Globus, the current release keeps
 that compatibility but can also be used independently.
 .
 With ARC-1, the user gains flexibility with additional services and
 more supported platforms. The service developer notices that even for
 persistent functionality across the two major versions, what has been
 a script on the server side once, that was repeatedly started and ran
 through, this has now become a service. Those are only started once and
 can then be queried, which is far more efficient, far more responsive,
 and is no longer stateless but can observe changes of values over time.

Description: ARC Hosting Environment Daemon
 The NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance
 and support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced
 Resource Connector (ARC).
 .
 The ARC Hosting Environment Daemon (HED). This daemon presents a
 site to other participants on the grid.  An intrinsic component
 of any grid system is a mechanism allowing for the secure stateful
 communication with remote environments. HED prepares for such an
 environment and as such is the core of the ARC middleware. HED
 was however written in a way, that represents typical grid
 computing tasks (the sharing of CPU time or storage) to become
 just one possible service between a user and a remote machine.
 Many others are thinkable, and HED takes considerable effort
 away from the respective implementors.

 Developers with an interest to integrate the some functionality on
 a remote site via an interface compatible with ARC, may find it
 preferable to perform that remote invocation from within Python.
 While today most services in ARC are associated with computation or
 storage, there is no constraint on these applications.

Description: ARC dynamic installation of runtime environments
 The NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance
 and support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced
 Resource Connector (ARC).
 .
 For grid computing, a major challenge is to keep the working environments
 homogeneous between the sites.  To help this situation, runtime
 environments have been developed. Those can be added to or removed from
 a site, and this Janitor service helps automating this process.
 .
 The Janitor is a recent development and the community to prepare
 catalogues of dynamically installable packages still needs to
 evolve.
