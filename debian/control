Description: ARC grid middleware
 The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources together
 across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly referred to as 
 a "computational grid". Historically, grids address the organisation of
 distributed storage of data and parallel computation, but arbitrary services
 are thinkable.
 .
 Just like the web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was
 erected to analyse the experiments for high energy physics at CERN. The
 first release, ARC-0.x, was dependent on Globus, the current release keeps
 that compatibility but can also be used independently.
 .
 With ARC-1, the user gains flexibility with additional services and
 more supported platforms. The service developer notices that even for
 persistent functionality across the two major versions, what has been
 a script on the server side once, that was repeatedly started and ran
 through, this has now become a service. Those are only started once and
 can then be queried, which is far more efficient, far more responsive,
 and is no longer stateless but can observe changes of values over time.
