Description: ARC grid middleware
 The NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance
 and support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
 Connector (ARC).
 .
 The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources
 together across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly
 referred to as a "computational grid". Historically, grids address the
 organisation of distributed storage of data and parallel computation,
 but arbitrary services are thinkable.
 .
 Just like the web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was
 erected to analyse the experiments for high energy physics at CERN. The
 first release, ARC-0.x, was dependent on Globus, the current release
 keeps that compatibility but can also be used independently.
 .
 With ARC, the user gains flexibility
 with additional services and more supported platforms. The service
 developer notices that even for persistent functionality across the
 two major versions, what has been a script on the server side once,
 that was repeatedly started and ran through, this has now become a
 service. Those are only started once and can then be queried, which
 is far more efficient, far more responsive, and is no longer stateless
 but can observe changes of values over time.

Description: ARC Hosting Environment Daemon
 The NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance
 and support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
 Connector (ARC).
 .
 The ARC Hosting Environment Daemon (HED). This daemon presents a site
 to other participants on the grid. An intrinsic component of any grid
 system is a mechanism allowing for the secure stateful communication with
 remote environments. HED prepares for such an environment and as such
 is the core of the ARC middleware. HED was however written in a way,
 that represents typical grid computing tasks (the sharing of CPU time
 or storage) to become just one possible service between a user and a
 remote machine. Many others are thinkable, and HED takes considerable
 effort away from the respective implementors.
