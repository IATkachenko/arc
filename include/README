 This directory contains tree of header files refering to files 
with same name located in source directory src/ - actual header
files.

 The refered files constitute API of ARC HED software.

 Files' location in this tree is defined by how API is presented
to external developer.

 Actual header files are located next to corresponding source 
files and their location is defined by convenience of developers
of ARC HED.

 These files are not used during istallation procedure.

 Upon instalaltion actual header files get located under same
layout as files in this directory.

 Files in this directory are used through all ARC code. All 
source and header files of entire source tree must refer to 
actual header files through these ones.

 Code being built outside source tree should refer either to
installed actual header files or to those located in this 
directory. Due to similar layout switch between two options
does not require changes in source and header files of code.
Only building procedure need to be changed.
