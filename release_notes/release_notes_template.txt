Known issues
------------
  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES
    interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent process, such as some
    agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu system, because the
    python-dirq package is not available for them. The workaround is to build this package from
    source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used to describe jobs,
    and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite
    loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files. While
    all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log files may 
    receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
  * authorizedvo=<voname> will no longer create a list of VOs under each Share. As a 
    consequence, EMIES WS clients can no longer find a queue by VO name the same way as in 
    previous versions of ARC due to changes in the GLUE2 schema rendering.
