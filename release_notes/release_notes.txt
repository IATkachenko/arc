Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================


Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.0.0     xx xxxxx 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are very happy to announce the first release of the ARC 6 release series.

ARC 6 contains major improvements in the deployment, configuration and maintenance of ARC CE.
It also comes with new features and services while some legacy features have been removed.

Although there has been some major re-engineering in the code base (see below),
the interfaces are unchanged - ARC 5 clients (as of 5.X.Y) are compatible with an ARC 6 CE and vice versa.

With ARC 6 we hope to have greatly increased the ease of setting up and maintaining an ARC production site. 


Important Changes
-----------------

* Complete overhaul of configuration
* Validation of the ARC configuration is enforced by A-REX startup scripts. If you have configuration errors then A-REX will not start. [TO_DO: What is status of systemd and config checks?]
* Runtime environments (RTEs) must be explicitly enabled through the new arcctl tool (see below)
* Renaming of startup scripts and default log files

* The NorduGrid schema is no longer published by default - it must be enabled via the [infosys/nordugrid] block
* Gridmap files (although still supported) are no longer recommended. VO-based authorisation should be configured as described in http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/user/reference.html. 

* Nordugrid ARC no longer issues a bundle including documentation, gangliarc and nagios
  ** The documentation is no longer distributed as a separate package with the release.
     You can find the current and up-to-date (but not fully complete) doumentation online: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/index.html
     The old manuals are still available here: http://www.nordugrid.org/manuals.html - but please note that some of the contents is now obsolete. 
  ** The separate gangliarc component is discontinued, instead we now have ganglia integrated into AREX.
     For configuration options, see: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/admins/reference.html
  ** Nagios probes have their own release cycle and are no more included in the Nordugrid ARC release.
     The source-code together with the installation instructions can be found here: https://source.coderefinery.org/nordugrid/arc-nagios-plugins
     The Nagios packages are still hosted by the Nordugrid repository.


* Wallclock has changed to wallclock*cores [TO-DO: More info]
* [TO-DO - More things?]

Improvements and new features
-----------------------------

* Major server-side configuration changes
** Configuration has been cleaned up, regrouped and made more streamlined.
** ARC now comes with a so-called zero configuration - a preconfigured minimal ARC setup automatically installed with ARC,
   including test-CA and test host certificate for immediate test submission.
** ARC now operates with a so-called running configuration which is based on arc.conf
   (which is to be manually edited by the system administrator) but in addition includes any unchanged default values
   present in ARC. You can get a dump of the running configuration using the arcctl tool.
** Default values have had a big tidy up and are now handled consistently throughout ARC.

* A new server-side control tool: arcctl has been developed.
** With this tool you can handle the configuration, the RTEs, the jobs, and many other things related to running an ARC CE.

* The RTE framework
**  The RTE framework has got a redesigned architecture and largely extended functionality
  (default, installed, enabled RTEs, introduction of RTE prameters).
  It is controlled and operated by the arcctl tool.
 ** By enabling the DOCKER RTE, HTCondor batch systems now have docker support


* ARCHERY has been introduced as the new DNS-based service indexing catalogue retiring the ldap-based EGIIS

* The internal job-loop in A-Rex has been re-engineered to be event-driven in order to improve scalability. 

* Packaging has been restructured:
** Streamlined package name scheme
** ldap services have been separated out, as for instance WS and INTERNAL submission do not need ldap.
** The INTERNAL submission plugin is separately packaged.


* Two new submission interfaces have been included, both are *technology previews and not for production*
 ** The REST interface - enabled together with the A-Rex Web-Service.
 ** The INTERNAL interface - a special interface aimed for restrictive HPC sites,
    to be used with a local installation of the ARC Control Tower.

* [TO-DO: More?] 


Documentation
---------------------
The ARC 6 documentation has been rewritten in a modern format at a new location:  http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6

Parts of the old documentation contained in http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-ce-sysadm-guide.pdf
is still relevant, however things that have changed from ARC 5 to ARC 6 can only be found in the new documentation, and many things, especially information concerning configuration is obsolete.

Please note that although the most important parts of the ARC 6 documentation are in place, it is still not fully complete.
If you have questions, please contact us!
