Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03, the following bugs were fixed:

  * 3175 Condor back-end needs controldir option to be passed from the above modules
  * 3278 defaultttl is always set to default in CEInfo.pl regardless of arc.conf
  * 3415 Glue1 reports strange numbers for GlueCEStateRunningJobs; GLUE2 has negative ComputingShareLocalRunningJobs
  * 3458 Enable jura to re-report the job records from the archives
  * 3459 Jura fails to send/store local user id
  * 3466 WARNING in infoprovider.log failing to delete heartbeat file
  * 3467 xrsl outputfile=("/" "") is buggy in ARC5
  * 3469 Positive priority range forbidden in Gridengine
  * 3478 Cannot use EMI-ES interface with in-memory proxies (CredentialString)
  * 3480 No timestamps in jobreport_logfile
  * 3483 MaxSlotsPerJob is not properly published on PBSPro 12.x LRMS
  * 3485 Nordugridmap creates files that are 0600, but the contents are not secret
  * 3489 Conflicting stdout, stdin and .comment files in the HTCondor back-end

Fixed GGUS tickets:

  * 113745 Arc CE 5.0
 

Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent 
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
