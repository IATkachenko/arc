Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 19     November 09, 2018
-----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, mainly to address how ARC counts HELD jobs in Condor. 
The request was made through discussions in the wlcg-arc-ce-discuss email list.

In addition, this release includes some packaging related changes, and a couple
of other small bugfixes.

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.4.2 to 5.4.3
  * documents - from 2.0.19 to 2.0.20
Gangliarc, Nagios plugins and metapackages are unchanged.


 
Detailed notes
--------------

The following issues were fixed:

== ARC Server and core components

  * No changes


=== Accounting

  * No changes
 

=== Information system
    
  * Before this change all jobs in HOLD state were counted as queued.
    With this change, Condor jobs in HOLD state are only counted as QUEUED if
    HoldReasonCode == 16, otherwise they are counted as SUSPENDED (Bug 3753)
   
  
== ARC Clients

  * No changes
      
  
== Nagios plugins

  * No changes

  * 3725 gm-jobs -h crashes
  * 3733 ACIX uses method removed from latest python-twisted version

  * 3753 Condor held jobs should not be counted as queued

Known issues
------------
  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES
    interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent process, such as some
    agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu system, because the
    python-dirq package is not available for them. The workaround is to build this package from
    source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used to describe jobs,
    and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite
    loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files. While
    all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log files may 
    receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
  * authorizedvo=<voname> will no longer create a list of VOs under each Share. As a 
    consequence, EMIES WS clients can no longer find a queue by VO name the same way as in 
    previous versions of ARC due to changes in the GLUE2 schema rendering.
