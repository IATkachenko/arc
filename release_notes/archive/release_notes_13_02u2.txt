Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Compute Element

JURA reporting to APEL has improved and corrected treatment of several aspects:

  * WallDuration element is now always send, that is a mandatory element
  * JURA is updated to SSM 2.1.0
  * Implemented better VO group and role parsing mechanism by the CAR
  * Implemented hopefully the right VO structure for APEL
  * Empty VO Role is not sent in a CAR any more
  * Benchmark's type, value and description are now parsed the  from the arc.conf
  * Fixed bug and created error handling for incoming benchmark values
  * Documentation: added benchmark related configuration description and value
    type for a value of a benchmark


== Other components

No changes


GGUS tickets solved
-------------------

  * 91763 APEL reporting for ARC CE for T2_Estonia
  * 93794 APEL reporting for ARC CE on UA-IMBG
 
 
Known issues
------------

  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source.
  * arcmigrate is currently non-functional
  * Jobs submitted through EMI ES cannot be renewed or resumed
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes. 
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available.
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified.
