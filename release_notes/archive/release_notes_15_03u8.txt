Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 8          July 1, 2016
----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, addressing bugs discovered since release 15.03u7. The 
bugfix release also clarifies the usage of the delegationdb arc.conf 
configuration parameter introduced in the previous minor release.

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.1.1 to 5.1.2
  * documents - from 2.0.7 to 2.0.8
Nagios plugins, CAnL C++ and metapackages are unchanged.



Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Server and core components

The following issues were fixed in the ARC core:
  * Fixed an issue where delegation locks were not released properly and 
    potentially fill up the disk.
  * If you experience stability issues with A-REX it is now recommended to use 
    SQLite rather than BDB as delegation DB. SQLite can be enabled with 
    delegationdb="sqlite" in [grid-manager]. Please note that jobs should be 
    drained before switching between DBs if you rely on ARC CE to perform data
    staging, otherwise ARC CE will not be able to upload their output data.
  * Fixed a parsing issue in the sacct part of scan-SLURM-job.
  * Fixes in performance metrics.
  * Minor logging enhancements.

=== Accounting

  * No changes.

=== Information system

The following issues were fixed in the information system:
  * Minor logging enhancements.

== ARC Clients

The following issues were fixed in the ARC Clients:
  * Added some missing scripts for building SDK.

== Nagios plugins

  * No changes.

== Common authentication library CaNL++

  * No changes.



Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 7, the following bugs were fixed:

  * 3482 ARC cache service failed to stage data for job submitted via EMI-ES due to proxy issues


Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The
    only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files.
    While all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log
    files may receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
