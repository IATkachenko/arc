----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, addressing several bugs discovered since release

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.0.3 to 5.0.4
  * documents - from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5
Nagios plugins, CAnL C++ and metapackages are unchanged.

The packages nordugrid-arc-gangliarc and nordugrid-arc-nagios are now available from Fedora and EPEL repositories as well.


Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Server and core components

The following issues were fixed in the ARC core:
  * The information from .statistics file is now propagated to the job log file.
  * An issue was fixed where logrotation of ACIX caused /dev/null to be rotated and 
    consequently become a regular file.
  * PBS scan can now handle job IDs without suffix.
  
=== Accounting

  * File transfer statistics are now included in usage records to SGAS.

=== Information system

  * No changes

== ARC Clients

The following issues were fixed in the ARC Clients:
  * An issue where LFC replicas could not be listed with the GFAL plugin was fixed.

== Nagios plugins

  * No changes

== Common authentication library CaNL++

  * No changes



Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 4, the following bugs were fixed:

  * 3505 ACIX produces not only acix-cache.log, but also twistd.log
  * 3506 PBS scan does not handle job IDs without suffix
  * 3514 C++11 compatibility
  * 3519 jura does not report transfer statistics

Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent 
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files.
    While all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log 
    files may receive new log messages.
