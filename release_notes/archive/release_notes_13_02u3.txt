  * 2416 - problems with arc data tools and dCache https 
  * 3154 - Allow option of separate log file for WS interface and grid-manager 
  * 3172 - Submission via 'org.ogf.bes' interface seams failed to pass user's proxy certificate to authplugin
  * 3177 - Missing Glue1CEImplementationName in ARC Glue1 rendering
  * 3181 - Dangling .meta causes problems
  * 3186 - src:nordugrid-arc: uses deprecated find -perm +0123
  * 3197 - Problems with ServiceLevel in accounting records
  * 3199 - arcsync doesn't find any jobs
  * 3200 - Checksum comparison is sometimes not done when downloading input files
  * 3206 - using (middleware >= nordugrid-arc-x.y.z) doesn't work
  * 3215 - Different information endpoints publish different implementation names
  * 3217 - CentOS/SL6 package not create /var/spool/arc directory
  * 3218 - Things break in condor backend when config file is not in default location
  * 3219 - make use_ssl: false/true directly configurable for JURA from arc.conf


GGUS tickets solved
-------------------

  * 92862 - ARC job manager (2.0.1-1.el5) stops when data transfers fail 
 
 
Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for some jobs (e.g., ALICE) when using some of the back-ends 
    (e.g., LoadLeveler and SLURM). The SGE backend is not affected.
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source.
  * arcmigrate is currently non-functional
  * Jobs submitted through EMI ES cannot be renewed or resumed
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes. 
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available.
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified.
