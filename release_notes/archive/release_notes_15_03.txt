Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================

Release Announcement for NorduGrid ARC 15.03                 March 27, 2015
--------------------------------------------

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware is an Open Source 
software solution to enable distributed computing infrastructures with the 
emphasis on processing large volumes of data. ARC provides an abstraction 
layer over computational resources, complete with input and output data 
movement functionalities. The security model of ARC is identical to that of
Grid solutions, relying on delegation of user credentials and the concept of
Virtual Organisations. ARC also provides client tools, as well as API in C++,
Python and Java.

ARC 15.03 is a major release of ARC, including the following component upgrades:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 4.2.0 to 5.0.0
  * documents - from 1.5.0 to 2.0.0
  * Nagios plugins - from 1.8.1 to 1.8.2
CAnL C++ v1.0.1, gangliarc v1.0.0 and metapackages v1.0.7 are unchanged.

ARC development is coordinated by the NorduGrid Collaboration (www.nordugrid.org).
The previous production ARC release, version 13.11u2, was released on August 14, 2014.


Upgrade and deployment notes
----------------------------

Upgrade is straightforward when standard Linux repositories are used, however 
please take note of configuration changes below. An automatic update is not
recommended for this new major release. When using NorduGrid repositories,
please switch to the 15.03 channel. Services (A-REX, GridFTPd and information
system) will restart automatically upon package upgrade. Should they not
restart, or when upgrade is done from source, manual restart is needed as per
documentation.

For a first installation (from scratch), use of metapackages is recommended.
Please consult ARC server and client deployment documentation.

Known issues are described later in this document.

Deployment notes:

  * arc-ur-logger is removed and sites reporting to SGAS through 
    arc-ur-logger should use JURA instead. To migrate from ur-logger to JURA, 
    follow the description under this URL:

    Note that the log_vo option used by arc-ur-logger is not yet implemented in 
    JURA.
  * cache-service is deprecated
  * UNICORE client is deprecated
  * CREAM client and corresponding job description language is deprecated
  * job.xml is deprecated
  * ARGUS based identitymap is deprecated
  * Migration feature in A-REX and migration API is deprecated

== ARC Server and core components

  * Removed LCF DMC, DQ2 DMC, old data staging, SAML service and slcs service
  * Added option to disable partial HTTP GET in A-REX and in URLs. Configurable 
    with httpgetpartial option in [data-stager] in arc.conf and with 
    httpgetpartial URL option in URLs. Default is httpgetpartial=yes. Note that 
    setting httpgetpartial=no can significantly increase download speed for large
    files
  * Added option cacheshared to the [data-staging] section to enable better 
    management of caches on filesystems shared with other data
  * Added option cachespacetool to the [data-staging]section to allow a 
    user-specified tool for the cache cleaner to find file system space information
  * Added option to use sacct in SLURM backend. Configurable with option 
    slurm_use_sacct in [common] section in arc.conf. Default is no
  * Support for SSLv3 is now disabled
  * Many bugfixes, see details below
  
=== Accounting

  * arc-ur-logger was removed, JURA should be used instead
  * Added logging to JURA. For the logging to be enabled, jobreport_logfile must be
    set in the [grid-manager] section of arc.conf
  * JURA now provides the same values to SGAS and APEL
  * Many bugfixes, see details below

=== Information system

  * Several bugfixes, see details below

== ARC Clients

  * Removed arcmigrate
  * Several bugfixes, see details below

== Nagios plugins

    add GlueSAPath as a fallback for GlueVOInfoPath for SRM checks
  * Delayed some IGTF warnings which were raised before the publication day
  * Fixed parsing of arcstat output for GLUE2-enabled CEs, using "Status"
    instead of "Specific status"
  * Fixed /tmp file leak when arccp fails, and improved related logging
  * Added --min-proxy-lifetime option and increased default to avoid expiration
    before the job is run
  * Fixed missed passive state update when arcget output dir was absent

== Common authentication library CaNL++

   * No changes

Packaging changes
-----------------

No major packaging changes have taken place.


Configuration changes
---------------------

  * The following arc.conf options have been moved from the [grid-manager]
    section to the [data-staging] section: speedcontrol, securetransfer,
    passivetransfer, maxtransfertries, acix_endpoint, localtransfer,
    preferredpattern, copyurl, linkurl. Be sure to update configuration before
    restarting A-REX after the update.
  * The new option cacheshared has been added to the [data-staging] section to enable better management of caches on
    filesystems shared with other data
  * The new option cachespacetool has been added to the [data-staging] section to allow a user-specified tool for the cache cleaner to find file system space information.
  * The new option httpgetpartial has been added to the [data-staging] section.
  * The new option jobreport_logfile has been added to the [grid-manager] section.


API changes
-----------

API changes from libraries version 4.2.0 to 5.0.0 are documented at
http://wiki.nordugrid.org/index.php/API_changes 


Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent 
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified
  * JURA cannot send/store local user ids
