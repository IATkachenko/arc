Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================

Release Announcement for NorduGrid ARC 11.05                          May 5 2011
--------------------------------------------

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware, introduced by NorduGrid
(www.nordugrid.org), is an open source software solution enabling production
quality computational and data Grids since May 2002. The previous production ARC
release, version 0.8.3.1 was released on December 21, 2010.

The 11.05 release of the ARC software represents a major change, for the first
time in history of ARC introducing a very substantially re-written computing
element (execution service), and for the second time - a re-written client
component. Moreover, distribution and version conventions of ARC and its
packages change in order to accommodate latest developments in European Grid
middlewares. Code repository underwent major changes as well. For the reasons
above, careful upgrade from older ARC releases is advised, following the
suggested migration instructions. While in general the upgrade procedure is
reasonably smooth, you may encounter difficulties in case your system was
configured in a severely customized manner.


New version convention, packaging and distribution
--------------------------------------------------

In previous ARC releases, release number was identical to that of the
individual package version. This caused certain limitations and confusion.
Starting with 11.05, ARC releases follow the numbering scheme familiar for
Ubuntu users: first two digits indicate release year (2011), next two digits
separated by a period indicate release month (5 for May), and eventual next
two digits after a period denote incremental minor release version (absent for
the major release).

Packages constituting an ARC release changed their contents, some keeping the
names (when the contents was completely analogous, like nordugrid-arc-client),
and some changing the name. Packages containing preview "nox" components in
ARC 0.8 series became regular nordugrid-arc packages. Details of new packaging
convention can be found in NorduGrid Wiki (wiki.nordugrid.org).

Package version number follows the traditional approach: underscoring the major
step forward, most ARC packages in release 11.05 acquire version number 1.0.0.
For packages that preserve their names it makes an auto-upgrade technically
possible. Package numbers are in general independent from each other, such
that ARC releases in future will see more packages with differing versions. A
change of a package version does not necessarily trigger a new ARC release.
More details on version numbering and rules can be found in NorduGrid Wiki.

To prevent accidental auto-upgrade, NorduGrid switches to the new repository
structure, introducing new repository for each major release. This also allows
to maintain support for older releases, if necessary.

Several key ARC 11.05 packages built for Scientific Linux 5 x86_64 are also
distributed with the EMI-1 release. Package naming, numbering and dependencies
in EMI is identical to those in ARC releases.

Previously existing meta-packages are re-defined to include new components:
* nordugrid-arc-client-tools (client tools, plugins, Python and Java wrappers,
  CA policies)
* nordugrid-arc-compute-element (A-REX, ARIS, Janitor, gridftp server and user
  mapping utility)
* nordugrid-arc-information-index (EGIIS)


New features highlights
-----------------------

ARC 11.05 collects and integrates several innovative next generation services
and client tools into a consistent software release. All these components were
available for preview in ARC 0.8 releases ("nox" packages), and now are mature
enough to become mainstream.

ARC 11.05 adds a new client that can be installed on both Microsoft Windows and
Mac OS X. It can also submit jobs both through the old gridftp interface of ARC
0.8 as well as through the new, more standard-conforming, WS-based interface.
Old client tools (as in ARC 0.8 series) are available still, as a compatibility
package. Standalone client tar-ball includes both old and new clients.

The Grid Manager based computing element has been replaced by a re-factored and
improved version called A-REX (ARC Resource-coupled EXecution service).

Information system now supports publishing information following the GLUE2
standard, and support for GLUE 1.2 is improved for compatibility with gLite
within EMI.

As an experimental feature, new data staging framework is included in A-REX. It
aims to address shortcomings presented by the older uploader/downloader
methods, but so far it is turned off by default.

A number of other new features are introduced (see the following sections),
prompting some changes in the configuration. More details can be found in
migration guides:

  http://wiki.nordugrid.org/index.php/Migration_from_0.8


IMPORTANT change: With this ARC release, the Grid Manager based compute element
will reach its End of Life support. Please (re-)read the previously communicated
change and implications:

ARC components: detailed new features and deployment notes
-----------------------------------------------------------

ARC components term is introduced to denote logical grouping of tools and
services. The components are:
* Core
* Compute Element (CE)
* Clients
* gridftp server
* Information System

For installation purposes, they are grouped into meta-packages (gridftpd server
is included into Compute Element meta-package, and Core is a common dependency).

Apart of these, the following services are available:
* ISIS - WS-based information system
* Chelonia - Experimental lightweight self-healing storage framework

The following changes are common for several components:

* ARC is now installed under /usr instead of /opt/nordugrid
* ARC libraries now use so-names
* Several components can now be used with SELinux
* ARC can now be compiled with ICC
* ARC now has many more unit-tests further increasing the reliability of the
  software
* A new configuration-format (XML) is now supported together with the
  old arc.conf (INI)
* ARC will by default use logrotate to rotate logs when installed
  via binary repositories
* By default, ARC now logs in /var/log/arc


== ARC Core

New features:
* HED code cleaned up for Argus integration
* Implemented full request in Argus plugin using ARC schema
* Time resolution in HED increased to nanoseconds
* HED logging framework extended to be compatible with external log
  rotation solutions
* More logging formats introduced for special cases
* Introduced per-thread objects handling for more fine grained logging
* Enhanced configuration framework to increase usability
* Support for Python3000 in language bindings
* Functionality improvements in XML handling
* Performance enhancements of Loader module by avoiding multiple
  loading/scanning of same plugin
* Added additional authorization protection in delegation interface classes
* New implementation of file locking. Now with timeouts and owner control.
* The nordugrid grid-update-crls security utility is deprecated in
  favour of fetch-crl.
* Performance improvements of GridFTP module

Deployment notes:
* Note that this installation removes grid-crl-update and replaces it with
  fetch-crl which renders the nordugrid-arc-ca-utils package empty. For backward
  compatibility, fetch-crl is enabled through cron.

== ARC Compute Element

New features:
* Migration to the new code base completed.
* Grid Manager service is completely refactored and re-engineered, while
  keeping all of its key features, including automatic data caching
  and staging. The "replacement" is called A-REX (for ARC Resource-coupled
  EXecution service), which is a more sustainable, scalable and extensible (e.g.
  via plugins) solution.
* A-REX provides a new WS-based interface in addition to the gridftp-based
  pre-WS interface, thus preserving backwards interface compatibility.
* A-REX can publish, through the LIDI WS interface, GLUE2 XML information
* A-REX comes with set of information providers that can feed GLUE2 LDAP
  information into the ARIS service.
* A-REX comes with support for new back-end for the EDGI 3GBridged.
* A-REX can now handle routing queues in PBS
* Support for setting a "defaultmemory" attribute in arc.conf, which will
  be used in case a user does not specify memory requirements in the job
  description.
* As an experimental feature A-REX offers improved input/output data handling
  framework.
* As an experimental feature A-REX comes with and ARGUS authorization plugin
* The dynamic runtime environment module, Janitor, is another experimental
  new feature.
* Janitor has no redland dependency any more


Deployment notes:
* For sites deploying ARC 0.8.3 or ARC 0.8.3.1 releases, a smooth upgrade path
  via Yum is provided. Since this will imply switch from Grid Manager to
  A-REX, careful check is advised. Please refer to Grid Manager EOL notes
  (http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/gm-eol.html) for details.
* To deploy a functional computing element with the current production
  interfaces one needs to install the new nordugrid-arc-arex package
  together with ARIS and gridftp server packages, or the
  nordugrid-arc-compute-element meta-package. ARIS and gridftp are necessary to
  provide backward interface compatibility. It is also recommended to deploy
  the gridmap-utils package (included in the meta-package).
* To start the A-REX service use "/etc/init.d/a-rex start" (there is a
   compatibility grid-manager symlink provided, too).
* By default, A-REX uses configuration file from the old Grid Manager.
  Configurations taken from previous ARC CE deployments should work out of the
  box, though there were numerous changes to the configuration parameters and
  options. None of the changes is backward incompatible. Details are available
  in migration notes (see Additional documents section).
* None of the experimental features is turned on by default
    
== ARC Information System

New features:
* Naming change to avoid ambiguity: ARIS (ARC Resource Information System)
  replaces GRIS and EGIIS (Enhanced Grid Information Indexing System) replaces
  GIIS
* ARIS can publish GLUE2 information via LDAP
* Initial support for making ARIS act as a gLite's SiteBDII (experimental).
* Improved file locking in the EGIIS index server relay utility
* Stability fixes in both ARIS and EGIIS.
* Improved handling of non-ASCII information
* The start-up script now handles bad shutdowns properly
* Information system can now be run as a non-privileged user (start as
  root, set user in arc.conf, default is the LDAP-user)
* Infoproviders publish validity of host credentials in ARC schema

Deployment notes:
* ARIS is deployed by installing the nordugrid-arc-aris package. If you are
  upgrading from an earlier release, the update should be automatic from any of
  the previous packages (nordugrid-arc-infosys-ldap,
  nordugrid-arc-nox-ldap-infosys).
* EGIIS is deployed by installing the nordugrid-arc-egiis package. If you
  are updating from an earlier release, the update from nordugrid-arc-nox-giis
  should be automatic. A meta package nordugrid-arc-information-index is also
  provided for easy deployment.
* In order to keep publishing the same information as in GRIS before, no
  configuration changes are needed.
* New configuration options were introduced for enabling publishing new
  information in ARIS. In order to enable or disable different information
  schemas in the output, the following variables can be set in the [infosys]
  section of the arc.conf (defaults as indicated below):

    infosys_nordugrid="enable"
    infosys_glue12="disable"
    infosys_glue2_ldap="disable"

  In order to publish site BDII information a new [infosys/site/<sitename>]
  section should be added to the arc.conf configuration file, containing a
  unique_id option identifying the site and a URL option giving the address to
  the resource BDII.

== ARC Clients

New features:
* New compute and data clients (arcsub, arcstat, arcls, arccp etc.) replace
  analogous previous clients (ngsub, ngstat, ngls, ngcp, ngrm, ngtransfer,
  ngstage, ngacl).
* The new clients can be installed on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows in addition
  to Linux.
* Introduction of a modular architecture, which comes to its power in the
  libarcclient and libarcdata2 libraries.
* Modular libarcclient allows easy extension for additional services, ranking
  algorithms, or job description languages.
* New plugins-based data library, libarcdata2, replaces previous data library.
* Compute client comes with plugins providing functionality for job submission,
  resubmission, and job management against the pre-WS ARC, A-REX, CREAM and any
  BES-based Execution Service.
* Compute client supports job migration between A-REX instances.
* Compute client supports resource discovery based on EGIIS, ISIS and BDII
  index services.
* Compute client offers matchmaking and ranking by shortest queue, clock speed,
  benchmark or data location.
* Compute client offers job description translation between the XRSL, JSDL and
  JDL languages.
* Data access is now managed through DMCs, protocol-specific plugins.
* Improved default output for arcls, now closer to UNIX ls. Options are
  provided to specify non-default output.
* Improved error messages for arcls and arccp, improved calculation of file
  checksums.
* URLs in arcsub -c can be replaced by short target names.
* arcsub supports multiple RSL in one file


Deployment notes:
* The new clients (arc*) are available from the nordugrid-arc-client package.
* The behaviour and interface of the new clients slightly differ from the old
  ones, so for  compatibility reasons the ng* still distributed in the
  nordugrid-arc-compat package.
* The libarcclient and libarcdata2 libraries are available from the
  nordugrid-arc package.
* The DMCs and different plugins are available from
  nordugrid-arc-plugins-needed and nordugrid-arc-plugins-globus (the latter
  requires a number of Globus packages).
* The old arclib is now replaced by the new libraries and tagged as obsolete
  (though still available).

== ARC gridftp server

New features:
* Code moved over to the HED code base, removing previous duplications
* Numerous code fixes to comply with more strict compilers
* Works on non-Linux systems
* Builds without GACL
* Startup script is compliant with Fedora requirements
