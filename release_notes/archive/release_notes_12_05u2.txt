This is a bug fix release, addressing several critical bugs. The update
includes improved JURA reporting to APEL and significantly improved Nagios
probes. Authorship and license information is cleaned-up and synchronised
across different components.

EMI-ES implementation is disabled in this release, and those wishing to
use EMI-ES are advised to upgrade to ARC 13.02.

GLUE2 implementation is experimental in this release. Those willing to
use it in production MUST upgrade to ARC 13.02.

  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
  * documents - from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1
  * Nagios plugins - from 1.3.11 to 1.6.0
CAnL C++ and metapackages are unchanged; old client tools (ng*) and GUI are
re-built with new libraries


ARC components in 12.05 update 2:

ARC components: detailed notes
-------------------------------


== ARC Core

The DataDelivery Service can now run without a host certificate - see
http://wiki.nordugrid.org/index.php/Data_Staging/Multi-host for more details.

Numerous small enhancements and fixes in the Core libraries, see the list of
fixed bugs below. 


== ARC Clients

Few bug fixes, see the list of fixed bugs below.


== ARC Compute Element

The configuration option enable_emies_interface is no longer available in this release.
The EMI-ES implementation in this release is incomplete and for this update it was 
decided to disable it completely. If this option is present in arc.conf it must be 
removed or A-REX will fail to start. In order to use EMI-ES, please upgrade to ARC 13.02.

Numerous bugs are fixed in A-REX and batch back-ends, including several critical ones,
see the list of fixed bugs below.

JURA reporting to APEL has significantly improved.


== ARC Information System

Numerous bug fixes (see the list below) and improvements in error messages.


== ARC gridftp server

Code clean-up and improvements; correct implementation of voms_trust_chain.


== Common authentication library CaNL++

This component has not changed since release 12.05u1.


== Nagios plugins

Nagios plugins have been significantly improved. Please consult release notes for ARC 13.02
for details about changes between v1.3.11 and v1.5. Changes between v1.5 and v1.6 are:

  * Several bugs and GGUS tickets are resolved, see the list below.
  * Files used for input-staging tests are now automantically uploaded if
    they are missing when the job is submitted.
  * An option was added to import Python modules on probe startup.  This
    allows the registration of custom job tests and substitution methods.
  * Various additions and updates to the manual:  How to run Nagios probes
    from the command-line, the new substitution mechanism, the splitting of
    the entry points, the previously undocumented check_arcstatus.
  * Intercept some exceptions caused by configuration errors, so that they
    are not flagged as bugs.
