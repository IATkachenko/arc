ARC components: detailed notes
-------------------------------


== ARC Core

API documentation has improved. Few bugs were fixed, see the list below.


== ARC Clients

Improvements in error and help messages, some bug fixes, see the list below.


== ARC Compute Element

Compound executable instructions are now intercepted, and a proper error is
thrown. Some major bug fixes, see the list below.

JURA reporting to APEL has significantly improved.


== ARC Information System

Several bug fixes, see the list below.


== ARC gridftp server

Code clean-up and improvements.


== Common authentication library CaNL++

No changes


== Nagios plugins

Nagios plugins have been significantly improved. Please consult release notes for ARC 13.02
for details about changes between v1.3.11 and v1.5. Changes between v1.5 and v1.6 are:

  * Several bugs and GGUS tickets are resolved, see the list below.
  * Files used for input-staging tests are now automantically uploaded if
    they are missing when the job is submitted.
  * An option was added to import Python modules on probe startup.  This
    allows the registration of custom job tests and substitution methods.
  * Various additions and updates to the manual:  How to run Nagios probes
    from the command-line, the new substitution mechanism, the splitting of
    the entry points, the previously undocumented check_arcstatus.
  * Intercept some exceptions caused by configuration errors, so that they
    are not flagged as bugs.

Known issues
------------

  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source.
  * arcmigrate is currently non-functional
  * Jobs submitted through EMI ES cannot be renewed or resumed
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes. 
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available.
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified.
