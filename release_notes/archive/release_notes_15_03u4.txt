Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 3, the following bugs were (partially) fixed:

  * 3470 Watchdog did not restart arched after segfault
  * 3473 A-rex crashes after input/output jobs handling
  * 3487 ACIX picks up cachedir in arc.conf from nordugridmap section
  * 3498 Document how the sysadmin can manually add GLUE2 OSName, OSVersion, OSFamily
  * 3501 The presence of acix_endpoint option in arc.conf changes the SURLs of the input files
  * 3505 ACIX produces not only acix-cache.log, but also twistd.log
  * 3507 DTR crashes, possibly from corrupt file in cache
  * 3510 arcstat and arcsub uses unsafe temporary files
  * 3511 seg fault in DTR during ACIX/Rucio resolving
  * 3512 ARC doesnâ€™t use delayed passive for gridftp
  * 3513 submit-pbs-job incorrectly specify local job priority

Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent 
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
