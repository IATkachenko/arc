Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Core

Two new features were added to the ARC core:
  * A new ACIX DMC to allow discovery of locations of cached copies of data.
  * A new Rucio DMC for access to new ATLAS data management system.
In addition, many bugs were fixed, see the list below.

== ARC Compute Element

A new back-end was added for running ARC jobs through BOINC. In 
addition, many bugs were fixed, see the list below.

== Other components

VO filtering was added to the JURA jobreporter, so that JURA now matches 
all features of arc-ur-logger. In addition, many bugs were fixed, see 
the list below.

API changes
-----------

API changes from libraries version 4.0.0 to 4.1.0 are documented at
http://wiki.nordugrid.org/index.php/API_changes 
 

Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent 
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source.
  * arcmigrate is currently non-functional
  * Jobs submitted through EMI ES cannot be resumed
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes. 
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available.
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified.
