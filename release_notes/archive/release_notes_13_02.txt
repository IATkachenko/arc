Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================

Release Announcement for NorduGrid ARC 13.02                  February 28, 2013
--------------------------------------------

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware, introduced by NorduGrid
(www.nordugrid.org), is an open source software solution enabling production
quality computational and data Grids since May 2002. The previous production
ARC release, version 12.05u1, was released on November 8, 2012.


Upgrade and deployment notes
----------------------------

Upgrade is straightforward when standard Linux repositories are used. A-REX and
GridFTPd will restart automatically, while infosystem services will need a
manual start:

   nordugrid-arc-slapd start
   nordugrid-arc-bdii start
   nordugrid-arc-inforeg start

In order to enable new features in the ARC Compute Element, changes in the
arc.conf are needed, as described below.

For a first installation (from scratch), use of metapackages is recommended.
Please consult ARC server and client deployment documentation.

Known issues (e.g., APEL accounting on Debian) are described below.


Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

  * ISIS, Janitor, Chelonia and Hopi are removed from the distribution
  * libarcclient library is renamed to libarccompute
  * libarcdata2 library is renamed to libarcdata
  * ngconfigtest is renamed to arc-config-check, installs to libexec instead of
    bin and is packaged with A-REX instead of common package. New "validate"
    option is added to A-REX init script which calls arc-config-check.
  * xrootd DMC is moved out of plugins-globus package and into a new package
    nordugrid-arc-plugins-xrootd
  * arcsrmping utiity is removed
  * The Python utility module arcom is obsoleted
  * ClientInterface classes are moved to new libarccommunication library.
  * ExecutionTargetSet class is replaced with ExecutionTargetSorter for sorting
    ExecutionTarget objects
  * Main attributes of the Job class are changed, also in the jobs.xml:
    Cluster and the InterfaceName attributes are removed, JobID is changed
    from URL to string, ServiceInformation, JobManagement and JobStatus URL
    are added, as well as attributes InterfaceName, StageIn, StageOut and
    SessionDir.
  * Support for per-user control directories in A-REX is removed, as well as
    corresponding "control" option from arc.conf. Added support for
    substitutions in configuration based on dynamically mapped local user.
  * GridFactory back-end is removed
  * RLS support is removed
  * Perftest is renamed to arcperftest and man page is added.
  * Some test and misc tools are moved to a new sub package
    nordugrid-arc-misc-utils: arcwsrf, arcemiestest, arcperftest,
    saml_assertion_init 
  * GLUE2: all endpoints are now shown inside the A-REX org.nordugrid.arex
    ComputingService
  * EMI-ES rendering: one Endpoint per port-type including data capabilities


New features highlights
-----------------------

  * EMI ES interface is implemented in ARC client tools
  * Support for EMI ES interface version 1.16 is implemented in A-REX service
  * Communications with ARGUS PEP and PDP are implemented and integrated into
    A-REX
  * CAR 1.2 accounting messages can be sent to an APEL destination
  * nordugridmap is updated to version 2.0
  * ACIX (ARC Cache Index) is added to the distribution (RHEL>=5, Fedora>=7,
    Debian>=4)
  * New package nordugrid-arc-plugins-gfal is added, containing the GFAL DMC
    and depending on gfal2 (RHEL/Fedora only)
  * xRSL parser is extended to parse "countpernode" and "exclusiveexecution"
    attributes used for expressing parallel setup requirements
  * GLUE2 rendering is finalised, also in the EMI-ES context
  * Introduced a relay backend in LDAP configuration for interoperability
    with GLUE2 Top-BDII, and changed the top element of Glue1 schema to match
    the needs of Glue1 Top-BDII. Now an ARC CE can directly be aggregated by
    a Top-BDII if ARIS LDPA URL is configured correctly in GOCDB.
  * Improved automatic slapd/BDII backend configuration. In particular,
    BDII paths are automatically generated and can be removed from arc.conf.
    Removing them from arc.conf during update is recommended, unless one knows
    exactly how BDII configuration works.


ARC components: detailed new features
-------------------------------------

ARC components in release 13.02 are:

  * ARC Core (includes documents)
  * ARC Clients
  * ARC CE
  * ARC Infosys
  * ARC gridftp server
  * Nagios plugins
  * Common authentication library CaNL++


== ARC Core

Most significant improvements in the ARC Core are:

  * Handle out-of-band data at TCP layer.
  * Watchdog implemented for arched container and used in A-REX. See
    documentation for configuration options.
  * Support for plugin priorities added.
  * Add errno-like field to DataStatus class
  * Cache service can run in same arched as A-REX with shared DTR instance
  * Implement 3rd party transfer in data library (new method
    DataPoint::Transfer3rdPaty()) and arccp (new option -3) using GFAL DMC
  * HTTP implementation in data plugin enhanced to support redirection and
    chunked transfers for all functions.
  * Security plugin (Argus PDP Client) supports the contact with Argus PDP
    server to achieve access control decision. Argus library dependency is
    not required for this plugin.
  * Change DataPoint API - Check() now takes a bool parameter to determine
    whether metadata information should be obtained during permission check.
  * Add DataPoint::Rename() for renaming files.
  * Add ability to run DataDelivery service without the need for a host
    certificate. See documentation for configuration details.
  * Removed ability to set locale per LogDestination
  * Transparently load native ARC JNI-C++ library when using ARC Java
    bindings. Thus making it redundant to call 'System.loadLibrary("jarc")'.
  * Splitting Python bindings into multiple modules
  * List classes in ARC Java bindings now implements the Iterable Java
    interface. That makes it possible to use list objects in Java foreach
    statement. Adapting the listiterator classes in order to comply with the
    Java Iterator interface which those classes.
  * Adding support for storing job information in Berkeley DB. Only available
    in the library (libarccompute) and language bindings, but not in the CLI.


== ARC Clients

Most significant improvements in the ARC Clients and SDK are:

  * EMI ES interface is implemented in ARC client tools. See documentation
    and man-pages for new interface names.

  * arcproxy can support the contacting to VOMS server with RESTful interface.
    See documentation and man pages for options.
  * arcproxy supports proxy retrieval from myproxy server with VOMS AC included
  * arcproxy supports proxy generation with VOMS AC included, when using
    credential source from NSS DB
  * arcproxy supports the detection of NSS DB from default location of
    Firefox, Seamonkey and Thunderbird.
  * Add NSS as a dependency. Currently used only by arcproxy

  * Add arcrename command. See documentation and man-page for functionality
    and possible options.
  * Improved formatting of arcls -l by aligning columns
  * Change recursion options for arccp and arcls. -r specifies infinite
    recursion and -D is used for a specific level or recursion.

  * arcsub adapted to use rebased submission functionality 
  * Extended arcsub to be able to submit directly to submission endpoints (no
    resource discovery and matchmaking).
  * Extending arctest to print DNs of installed CA-certificates.
  * Add new PythonBroker, ACIXBroker.py, which uses ACIX to rank sites by
    number of cached input files.

  * Adding possibility to format the CE specific job state string
  * Submitter class extended with capability of job submission relying on
    resource discovery and brokering, previously part of arcsub
  * Introducing new class ExecutionTargetSorter for sorting ExecutionTarget
    objects. It is to replace the ExecutionTargetSet class which isn't working
    as intended.
  * Significant fixes and cleanup in the CREAM job plugin.
  * Added submitting convenience methods to Submitter class which only takes
    endpoints and job descriptions as arguments.
  * Extending xRSL parser to parse "countpernode" and "exclusiveexecution"
    attributes used for expressing parallel setup requirements.
  * Improved backwards compatibility when reading job list files (client side).
    Job records from 1.x and 2.x is supported, 1.x and 2.x does not support the
    format used in 3.x. Support for NOX job record format is dropped. As always
    'arcsync' can be used to recover the job list.


== ARC Compute Element

Most significant improvements in the ARC Compute Element are:

  * SLURMmod.pm plugin with native ARC1 API is introduced
  * Make arc-ur-logger use ARC python API to retrieve information in proxy
    instead of relying on voms-proxy-info
  * Communications with ARGUS PEP and PDP are implemented and integrated into
    A-REX. See documentation for configuration options.
  * nordugridmap is updated to version 2.0. See documentation for configuration
    options.
  * Client files stage in performance enhanced by decreasing number of
    reconnections during one submission cycle.
  * Increase performance of client file staging to/from HTTPS interface
    of A-REX service by turning off encryption.
  * Administrator utility gm-jobs is extended to cancel and clean jobs, as
    well as to provide information about delegated tokens and filter jobs by
    identifier. See documentation and man-pages for new options.
  * Support for per-user control directories in A-REX is removed. Added support
    for substitutions in configuration based on dynamically mapped local user.
    See documentation for changes in configuration options.
  * Support for EMI ES interface version 1.16 implemented in A-REX service.
  * Added GRAMI support for EMI-ES parallel specification
  * A-REX default data staging mechanism is changed to DTR. The old system can
    still be used by setting enable_dtr="no" in arc.conf.
  * Added support for GLUE2 in SLURM infoprovider
  * Added parallel support in the LoadLeveler back-end
  * Removed GridFactory back-end

=== Accounting:

Several significant changes were made to the JURA accounting component, making
it compatible with the latest APEL version. Please see Known Issues below if
you are using a Debian/Ubuntu system.

  * Use 2.0.0 version of SSM to the message sending.
  * Parse the configured (optional) topic value from the server configuration.
  * Fixed the published MachineName attribute by JURA
  * Fixed the logger URL by the APEL destination
  * Fixed the non-published VO attributes
  * Send CAR 1.2 accounting messages to the APEL destination. See documentation
    for configuration options.
  * Set the non-standard compilation prefix by ssmsend location.


== ARC Information System

Improvements in the information system concerned finalising the GLUE2 schema
publishing, integration with Top-BDII, and integration with EMIR:

  * Improved bdii-update automatic configuration. BDII configuration commands
    are no longer needed in the [infosys] configuration block.
  * Finalized GLUE2 rendering:
    * Removed ARIS service. All endpoints are now shown inside
      the A-REX org.nordugrid.arex ComputingService. This makes the GLUE2
      rendering backward incompatible with previous versions of ARC.
    * Removed ComputingActivities from LDAP rendering. Can be enabled with
      infosys_glue2_ldap_showactivities, a new option.
    * Finalized EMI-ES rendering, one Endpoint per port-type
      including data capabilities. This obsoletes the experimental 12.05
      EMI-ES GLUE2 rendering and therefore makes this change backward
      incompatible.
    * added infosys_glue2_service_qualitylevel option for the sysadmin
      to set manually GLUE2 QualityLevel, useful for operations within
      EGI.
  * Implemented a solution for client to match GLUE2 Service ID even if
    looking at data from nordugrid schema.
  * Implemented a solution for the client to know which interface the
    job was submitted both in GLUE2 and Nordugrid schema.
  * Introduced a relay back-end in LDAP configuration for interoperability
    with GLUE2 Top-BDII. Now an ARC CE can directly be aggregated by
    a Top-BDII if ARIS LDAP URL is configured correctly in GOCDB.
  * Changed the top element of Glue1 schema to match the needs of
    Glue1 Top-BDII.
  * Added several fixes to Glue1 schema: localse, queue names.
  * Added infosys support for openldap2.4 on SLX distributions
  * Enabled GLUE2 schema rendering together with the old nordugrid schema
    in the LDAP-monitor.
  * Added new column in LDAP-monitor to the Queue table for GLUE2 rendering.


== ARC gridftp server

No changes have been made to this component.


== Nagios plugins

Nagios monitoring plugins evolved from release 1.3.9 to 1.5.0. Most significant
changes are: 

   * Fix EL5 compatibility issues
   * Add missing job name for check_arcce; don't report check
     errors unless job was fetched.
   * Adjust setup.py to use prefix-relative paths for scripts.
   * Fix JSDL specification of runtime environment.
   * Allow specifying RTEs in arcnagios.ini; may be important for SAM
     deployment.
   * Package the IGTF CA certificates check script.
   * Import check_arcservice probe
   * Add --check-contact option to the ARIS probe.
   * Improve configuration examples and comments and include them in the
     documentation.
   * Fix two issues with "check_arcinfosys aris --compare-glue".
   * Add a missing import to check_arcinfosys (thanks to pyflakes).
   * Fix format args in warning for check_arcinfosys.
   * Use alternate output paths to ply.yacc.yacc
   * Add check_archostcert (checks host certificate via infosys).
   * Add entry point to check_arcce to tidy jobs.xml after failed cleanup.
   * Fixed a bug which manifests in the GLUE2 check when it attempt to report
     that a primary key is not found, giving UNKNOWN instead of ERROR status.
   * Add additional information to the Nagios output for arcproxy failure and
     for the IGTF probe.
   * Add --queue option to "check_arcce submit".
   * Remove some confusing and redundant output.


== Common authentication library CaNL++

   * Improved unit tests coverage (almost complete)
   * More complete implementation of the extension and attribute handling for
     certificates
   * CaNL++ is integrated into an ARC client utility

Packaging changes
-----------------

= Information system

The package nordugrid-arc-aris has been split into two packages:
nordugrid-arc-aris and nordugrid-arc-ldap-infosys. 

  * To run a local information system (ARIS) requires nordugrid-arc-aris and
    nordugrid-arc-ldap-infosys
  * To run an information index (EGIIS) requires nordugrid-arc-egiis and
    nordugrid-arc-ldap-infosys 

= Data Management Components (DMCs)

The Data Management Component (DMC) plugins provide support for various Grid
data access protocols. In previous versions of ARC there were two packages:

  * nordugrid-arc-plugins-needed - for protocols file, http(s), arc, LDAP, SRM.
    This has no external dependencies. 
  * nordugrid-arc-plugins-globus - Globus-related protocols: gsiftp, RLS, LFC,
    xrootd. Depends on Globus and xrootd packages 

In EMI-3 the corresponding packages are:

  * nordugrid-arc-plugins-needed - for protocols file, http(s), arc, LDAP, SRM.
    This has no external dependencies. 
  * nordugrid-arc-plugins-globus - Globus-related protocols: gsiftp, LFC.
    Depends on Globus packages. 
  * nordugrid-arc-plugins-xrootd - xrootd protocol. Depends on xrootd packages.
  * nordugrid-arc-plugins-gfal - Plugin to interact with gfal2 as part of EMI
    datalib. Depends on core gfal2 packages. Protocol support within gfal2 is 
    provided by its own set of plugins which nordugrid-arc-plugins-gfal does
    not depend on.

Note: RLS is no longer supported.

= Common Authentication Library (CAnL++)

The ARC build depends on canl-c++ and a new package nordugrid-arc-arcproxyalt
has been released, containing a version of the arcproxy command line tool which
depends on CAnL++.

= ARC Cache Index (ACIX)

ACIX is packaged along with the rest of ARC in new packages

  * nordugrid-arc-acix-core - core components
  * nordugrid-arc-acix-cache - cache info collector which runs alongside the CE
  * nordugrid-arc-acix-index - service which indexes cache content from CEs

See the ARC CE system administrator manual for more information on ACIX.

= Miscellaneous utilities

A new package nordugrid-arc-misc-utils is available, containing various test and
other utilities. The following binary executables have been moved from the
nordugrid-arc-client package to this new package:

  * arcwsrf
  * perftest (renamed arcperftest)
  * saml_assertion_init

In addition a new binary executable is available in this package:

  * arcemiestest

= Discontinued packages

The following packages are no longer distributed

  * nordugrid-arc-chelonia
  * nordugrid-arc-hopi
  * nordugrid-arc-isis
  * nordugrid-arc-janitor


Configuration changes
---------------------

The ARC information system init script grid-infosys has been split into
separate components. The scripts to run depend on which component of the
information system you are running:

  * To start a local information system (ARIS):
        start nordugrid-arc-slapd
        start nordugird-arc-bdii

  * To start a information index server (EGIIS):
        start nordugrid-arc-slapd
        start nordugrid-arc-egiis

  * If you are running both an ARIS and an EGIIS you should only start the
    nordugrid-arc-slapd service once. 

  * To start the information registration process to other EGIIS services:
        start nordugrid-arc-inforeg

= arc.conf changes

For full description of all arc.conf configuration see arc.conf.reference,
distributed with ARC packages. 

  * New options arguspdp_endpoint and arguspdp_profile for ARGUS integration
  * New option watchdog for automatic service restart
  * New sections [acix/cacheserver] and [acix/indexserver] for ACIX
  * Option newdatastaging is deprecated. It has been renamed enable_dtr and is
    "yes" by default
  * Option control is no longer supported. controldir should be used instead


API changes
-----------

API changes from libraries version 2.0.1 to 3.0.0 are documented at
http://wiki.nordugrid.org/index.php/API_changes 


Known issues
------------

  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source.
  * arcmigrate is currently non-functional
  * Jobs submitted through EMI ES cannot be renewed or resumed
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes. 
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available.
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified.
