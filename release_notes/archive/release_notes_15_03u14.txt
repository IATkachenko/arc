Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 14      May 30, 2017
-----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, addressing bugs discovered since release 15.03u13
which suffered from a memory leak causing frequent crashes.

In this release numerous fixes have been implemented in order to make ARC more reliable and stable.

Highlights are:
* Many memory leaks and memory corruption cases have been eliminated.
* Effort has been made to improve a long-standing issue where ARC crashed or hung due to Glib process spawning.
* Likelihood of crashes and hangs due to file handle leaks should be reduced.
* Finally, the sqlite delegation store code has been optimized for increased speed. 


Note that as of ARC 5.3.0, incorrect treatment of namespace constraints is fixed,
resulting in rejection of certificates that do not comply with policies.


NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.3.0 to 5.3.1
  * Nagios plugins - from 1.8.4 to 1.9.0
  * documents - from 2.0.14 to 2.0.15
Gangliarc and metapackages are unchanged.



 
Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Server and core components

The following issues were fixed or partially fixed in the ARC core:
  * A partial solution for the missing detail level of EMI-ES submission interface's initial job status.
    State is now reported as "processing-queued". That will delay reporting job execution start but should avoid
    causing wrong impression of job starting, stopping and then starting again.(Bug 3640).
  * One major and several minor memory leaks and memory corruption cases were removed. (Bug 3651).
    The major memory leak resulted in ARC 5.3.0 crashing very frequently due to rapid increase of the consumed
    anonymous memory. The most important memory leaks are now removed. 
  * Changed delegation locking implementation which caused slow EMI-ES job submission for large job descriptions. (Bug 3652).
  * A long-standing issue with unreliable glib_spawn processes is fixed by replacing lib spawn process with pure fork.
    This in addition fixes bugs 2905 and 3456.
  * A long-standing issue with file handles leaks and improper use of file handles causing ARC to hang or crash is partially fixed. (Bug 3655).
  * arctest -J 1 now works again after the shut down of ftp.nordugrid.org. (Bug 3654).
  * Fixed problem that user input-files were truncated when submitting with the EMI-ES submission interface. (Bug 3659).
  * Various code cleanup and fixes.





=== Accounting

  * No changes.
 

=== Information system

The following issues were fixed in the information system:

  * No changes.
  
  
== ARC Clients

The following issues were fixed in ARC clients:

  * No clanges.

  
== Nagios plugins
Most important changes:
  * Move scheduled cleanup from `check_arcce_monitor` to `check_arcce_clean`.
    As a consequence users may want to run `check_arcce_clean` at least once
    per every hour.
  * Keep better track of the work done by `check_arcce_monitor` and
    `check_arcce_clean`. Try to bail out within a slotted time to avoid
    unclean exits and spurious Nagios alerts. Instead report on the progress
    and raise a warning or critical alerts if it seems like the probes are not
    keeping up.
  * Clean up jobs from the local ARC job file which cannot be queried and
    which do not correspond to any active job.
  * The operation of `check_arcce_monitor` can now be restricted to jobs for a
    certain CE and/or those having been created with a certain `--job-tag`.
    This should allow running one monitor service per CE and/or job type,
    though it has not been tested under Nagios.


Minor fixes:

  * Remove execute bit and shebang from `arcce_igtf.py`.
  * In `check_archostcert` consider certs unusable 2 days before expiration.
  * Various timeouts have been adjusted or added.
  * Fix repeated renaming of output directories from `arcget`.
  * Make random adjustments to rescheduled job times and process rescheduled
    and monitoring work in random order.
  * Remove deprecated `--use-jobs-xml` option from `check_arcce_clean` and
    some other ancient stuff which nobody will notice.
  * Avoid warning due to unparsed 12 hex-digit lines from `arcstat`.
  * Various minor fixes.
  


Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 13, the following bugs were fully or partially fixed:
  * 2905 - arex 2.0.1rc1 fails to change the job status from SUBMIT
  * 3456 - a-rex with glib version >2.32 uses inconsistent child control
  * 3640 EMI-ES interface wrongly reports initial job status
  * 3651 A-REX crashes or hangs every hour
  * 3652 EMI-ES job submission is slow for large job descriptions
  * 3655 ARC gets stuck after a short while and needs to be killed
  * 3654 Source files for arctest -J 1 unavailable from ftp.nordugrid.org
  * 3659 EMI-ES job submission LRMS error due to truncated executable



Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The
    only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files.
    While all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log
    files may receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
  * authorizedvo=<voname> will no longer create a list of VOs under each Share. As a consequence,
    EMIES WS clients can no longer find a queue by VO name the same way as in previous versions
    of ARC due to changes in the GLUE2 schema rendering.
