API changes
-----------

API changes from libraries version 4.1.0 to 4.2.0 are documented at
http://wiki.nordugrid.org/index.php/API_changes 
 

Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent 
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source.
  * arcmigrate is currently non-functional
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes. 
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available.
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified.
