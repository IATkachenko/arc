Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 18     December 13, 2017
-----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, addressing bugs discovered since release 15.03u17.

There are 3 fixed bugs in this version of ARC. These involve the infoprovider, EMI-ES submission interface,
and  multicore jobs use of scratchdir. See more details below. 

In addition memory leaks have been found and fixed, in Globus code and elsewhere in A-Rex. 

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.4.1 to 5.4.2
  * documents - from 2.0.18 to 2.0.19
Gangliarc, Nagios plugins and metapackages are unchanged.


 
Detailed notes
--------------

The following issues were fixed:

== ARC Server and core components

  * Single node multicore jobs now use scratch disk by default (Bug 3694).
  * Several memory leak fixes, and general cleanup and enhancements.  

=== Accounting

  * No changes
 

=== Information system

  * Negative VO numbers should no longer occur in GLUE2 VO ComputingShares (Bug 3686).

  
== ARC Clients

  * Jobs submitted via EMI-ES interface with non-dynamical output files will no longer fail due to missing delegations file.
    Full delegation is now always done by default in EMI-ES (Bug 3693).
      
  
== Nagios plugins

  * No changes



Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 17, the following bugs were fixed:
  * 3686 Negative VO numbers
  * 3693 ENV/PROXY fails to delegate full credential for EMI-ES job
  * 3694 multicore scratch fix to skip RUNTIME_ENABLE_MULTICORE_SCRATCH



Known issues
------------
  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES
    interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent process, such as some
    agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu system, because the
    python-dirq package is not available for them. The workaround is to build this package from
    source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used to describe jobs,
    and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite
    loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files. While
    all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log files may 
    receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
  * authorizedvo=<voname> will no longer create a list of VOs under each Share. As a 
    consequence, EMIES WS clients can no longer find a queue by VO name the same way as in 
    previous versions of ARC due to changes in the GLUE2 schema rendering.
