Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 16     September 18, 2017
-----------------------------------------------

This is a minor release, introducing new features and addressing bugs discovered since release 15.03u15. 

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.3.2 to 5.4.0
  * documents - from 2.0.16 to 2.0.17
Nagios plugins, Gangliarc and metapackages are unchanged.



Note:
In the process of fixing bug 3666 for ARC 5.3.2 a backward incompatibility was introduced in the EMI-ES interface.
This backward incompatibility is still present in 5.4.0.

If you run ARC < 5.3.2 you are asked to not turn on the EMI-ES interface, hence avoiding any problems.
Sites running ARC >= 5.3.2 should not suffer from the issue.



New features highlights
-----------------------

  * Code adaption to OpenSSL 1.1.x, specifically for distributions which build OpenSSL without deprecated functions.
  * Fix for handling signing_policy files which come with Windows-oriented editors. 
  * Increase in data transfer performance, mostly affecting chunked HTTP transfers.
  * Remove use of Credential objects in DTR, instead using strings for credential attributes. May help with data staging performance.
  * Technology preview of ARCHERY - The next generation Information Index Service for ARC.
    The ARCHERY client-plugin and ldap-monitor is included in this round. The ARCHERY-manage component will be released in ARC 6.



Information on ARCHERY technology preview and how to test it
------------------------------------------------------------

ARC Hierarchical Endpoints Registry (ARCHERY) publishes endpoints of resource providers directly in the DNS
by using the domain name as an entry point for resource discovery. ARCHERY is aimed to replace existing EGIIS services.
Compared to EGIIS it is not bound to LDAP endpoints and brings the reliability, integrity, caching and administration delegation
features of DNS to the grid indexes world. 

To start using ARCHERY just point the ARC client to the entry point domain name: arcsub -g nordugrid.org myjob.xrsl
No extra configuration needed, it works out of the box.
While NorduGrid Top-Level ARCHERY entry point in the nordugrid.org domain is under establishment,
anyone can use the testing instance at: archery-all.grid.org.ua.

NOTE that archery-manage is not shipped with this release.

More information can be found in the NorduGrid ARCHERY Architecture Overview document:

Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Server and core components

The following issues were fixed or partially fixed in the ARC core:
  * Potential issues having ARC build and function properly on distributions with OpenSSL 1.1.0.
    Code adaption to OpenSSL 1.1.x. Specifically for distributions which build OpenSSL without deprecated functions.
    Adaption includes fix to bug 3678.
  * Non-optimal data transfer perfomance affecting chunked HTTP transfers.
    Max allowed size of transfer buffer is increased to a reasonable size for modern computers.
    The fix may improve performance. 
  * Non-optimal staging performance. Some sites have reported congestions when dealing with jobs that have a large amount of input files.
    Removing the use of Credential objects in DTR may help staging performance. 
  

=== Accounting

  * No changes.
 

=== Information system

  * File containing XML description of the cluster is moved from temporary directory to controldir.
    This file is produced and consumed internally by A-REX and should not have any effect outside.
  * Fix to prevent VO computingshares producing negative number of running jobs.
    This is a technology preview, related to the partially fixed bug number 3686.
  * See above for information about ARCHERY.
  
== ARC Clients

  * Slight increase of performance for BES submission interface. 

  
== Nagios plugins

  * No changes.



Fixed or partially fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 15, the following bugs were fully or partially fixed:
  * 3678 HostInfo.pm doesn't find CA Issuer after upgrade to openssl 1.1.0.
  * 3669 Inconsistency of walltime/cputime report of multi-core jobs depending on the interface.
  * 3686 Negative VO numbers.



Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The
    only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files.
    While all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log
    files may receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
  * authorizedvo=<voname> will no longer create a list of VOs under each Share. As a consequence,
    EMIES WS clients can no longer find a queue by VO name the same way as in previous versions
    of ARC due to changes in the GLUE2 schema rendering.
