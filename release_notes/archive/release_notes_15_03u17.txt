Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 17     October 12, 2017
-----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, addressing bugs discovered since release 15.03u16.
Most work this time has happened in the ARC client. Se details below.

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.4.0 to 5.4.1
  * documents - from 2.0.17 to 2.0.18
Gangliarc, Nagios plugins and metapackages are unchanged.


 
Detailed notes
--------------

The following issues were fixed:

== ARC Server and core components

  * No changes.
  

=== Accounting

  * No changes.
 

=== Information system

  * Gridftp and EMI-ES job states were inconsistent. Example: If a job was in Pending:ACCEPTED
    in A-REX (because of limits on number of accepted jobs) the state was reported as ACCEPTED 
    in gridftp but as OTHER in EMI-ES. EMI-ES state is now instead reported as ACCEPTED.(Bug 
    3683).

  
== ARC Clients

  * When the 'force' flag was used with arcget, existing files were not overwritten when
    retrieveing jobs. Now existing job files, if any, are overwritten. (Bug 3673).
  * When using API several jobs were submitted with different credentials, those credentials
    were not properly propagated to server causing the job owner to be wrongly identified. (Bug
    3685).
  * Missing job priority in the ADL jobdescription. Now high priority jobs from ATLAS can be
    pushed to the front of the batch system queue and data staging priority can be controlled.
    (Bug 3687).
  * Wrongly set status of killed jobs prevented cleaning of jobs. (Bug 3689).
  
  
== Nagios plugins

  * No changes



Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 16, the following bugs were fixed:
  * 3673 arcget -f doesn't work
  * 3683 Inconsistent mapping of job states between gridftp and EMIES
  * 3685 Cannot submit jobs with two different proxies in same process to EMI-ES
  * 3687 ADL does not support priority
  * 3689 EMI-ES job submission interface - cleaning is not performed after user has killed the
    job.



Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES
    interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent process, such as some
    agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu system, because the
    python-dirq package is not available for them. The workaround is to build this package from
    source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used to describe jobs,
    and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite
    loop. The only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files. While
    all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log files may 
    receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
  * authorizedvo=<voname> will no longer create a list of VOs under each Share. As a 
    consequence, EMIES WS clients can no longer find a queue by VO name the same way as in 
    previous versions of ARC due to changes in the GLUE2 schema rendering.
