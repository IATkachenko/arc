Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 15.03 update 9       August 24, 2016
----------------------------------------------

This is a bugfix release, addressing bugs discovered since release 15.03u8. The 
bugfix release also introduces two auxilliary tools a-rex-backtrace-collect and 
gm-delegations-converter, see detailed notes.

NorduGrid ARC 15.03 has received an update to:
  * core, clients, CE, Infosys and gridftp - from version 5.1.2 to 5.1.3
  * documents - from 2.0.8 to 2.0.9
  * gangliarc - from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
Nagios plugins, CAnL C++ and metapackages are unchanged.



Detailed notes
--------------

== ARC Server and core components

The following issues were fixed in the ARC core:
  * Fixed an issue where A-REX crashed after failed DTR
  * Added support for managing services through the systemd system, as required 
    by the newest Fedora.
  * A tool was added to generate backtraces from core dumps generated by ARC.
    Usage: a-rex-backtrace-collect
    This will process core files collected in ARC_LOGS_DIR/arccore and produce
    backtraces for each of the core files. See man a-rex-backtrace-collect or 
    sysadmin guide for more details.
    Please note to that core files are now automatically enabled by the A-REX 
    startup script by setting ulimit -c unlimited.
  * There have been discovered several potential unstabilities in A-REX from
    the use of BDB for storing delegations and it is therefor recommended to use
    SQlite as delegations DB. To avoid the need to drain a cluster to be able to
    switch delegations DB, the tool gm-delegations-converter has been added.
    Usage: gm-delegations-converter
    This converts BDB database to SQLite database, overwriting the original
    database (meaning a backup of your original DB might be prudent). 
    See man gm-delegations-converter or sysadmin guide for more details.
    SQLite can be enabled with delegationdb="sqlite" in [grid-manager].
  * Various smaller enhancements and bugfixes.

=== Accounting

=== Information system

The following issues were fixed in the information system:
  * Added support for managing services through the systemd system, as required
    by the newest Fedora.

    by the newest Fedora.


Fixed bugs
----------

Since ARC 15.03 update 8, the following bugs were fixed:

  * 3427 a-rex crashes after failed DTR 
  * 3574 logrotate duplicate entry for /var/log/arc/perfdata/system.perflog from /etc/logrotate.d/nordugrid-arc-arex
  * 3580 Failed to store delegation on multithreaded job submission
  * 3578 Upload to S3 doesn't work with delivery service 
  * 3588 Missing conversion tool for switching to sqlite for delegation db


Known issues
------------

  * There is a memory leak when using Java API for multiple job submission with files to BES interface.
  * The CPU time is not measured correctly for jobs that kill the parent
    process, such as some agent-based/pilot (e.g., ALICE)
  * JURA will not publish records to the APEL on a standard Debian/Ubuntu
    system, because the python-dirq package is not available for them. The
    workaround is to build this package from source
  * When using ARC client tools to submit jobs to CREAM, only JSDL can be used
    to describe jobs, and the broker type must be set to Null in the client.conf
    file
  * ARC GUI (arcjobtool) is not available yet, pending implementation of client
    library changes
  * Standalone client tar-balls for Linux are not yet available
  * Bug 2905 is solved using workaround. Source of problem is not yet
    identified
  * A-REX can under some circumstances lose connection with CEinfo.pl and go into an infinite loop. The
    only current workaround is to restart the a-rex service.
  * twistd, the underlying engine for ACIX, sometimes logs into rotated ACIX log files.
    While all log messages are correctly logged in the main log file, some rotated log
    files may receive new log messages.
  * submit-*-job do not have permission to write performance metrics to log.
