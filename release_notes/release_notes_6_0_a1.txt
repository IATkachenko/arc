Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 6.0.0a1     12 November 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------
After a long ARC 6 preparation period, we are finally ready to announce the very first test release of ARC 6: the alpha release (6.0.0a1)

ARC 6 version is a major BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE release in the ARC development roadmap with lots of major internal re-engineering in the code base (see below).

As of the 6.0.0a1 test release most of the planned development is completed, only smaller adjustments and some code cleanup is missing.
Since July University of Oslo has been running ARC 6 with regular nightly updates.

Next step is to deploy this first test release on other sites, more sites deploying ARC 6 will mean more deployment, configuration and usage pattern are to be covered, more bugs discovered and fixed. So please volunteer to give it a try!



Improvements and new features
-----------------------------
* Major configuration changes
    * Configuration has been cleaned up, regrouped and made more streamlined. 
* ARC now comes with a so-called zero configuration - a preconfigured minimal ARC setup. Automatically installed with ARC, including test-CA and test host certificate for immediate test submission. 
* A new control tool: arcctl has been developed. With this tool you can handle the configuration, the runtime environment, the jobs, and many other things related to running an ARC CE.
* ARC now operates with a so-called running configuration which is based on arc.conf (which is to be manually edited by the system administrator) but in addition includes any unchanged default values present in ARC. You can get a dump of the running configuration using the arcctl tool. 
* Default values have had a big tidy up and are now handled consistently throughout ARC. 
* Packaging has been restructured:
   * Streamlined package name scheme
   * ldap services have been separated out, as for instance WS and INTERNAL submission do not need ldap.
   * The new INTERNAL submission plugin is separately packaged. This plugin is for use together with the ARC Control Tower in a special ARC mode.
