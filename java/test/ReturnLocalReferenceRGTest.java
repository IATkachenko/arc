/**
 * Regression test.
 * Garbage collection in Java does not respect scope, but rather tries to find
 * out when an object is not used any more. Thus a object might be garbage
 * collected before it goes out of scope.
 * For Java proxy classes wrapping a C++ class containing a method which returns
 * a C++ reference the issue above is important. When the java method, wrapping
 * the C++ method returning a C++ reference, returns an object (R) the memory of
 * that object (R) (C++ memory) is managed by the object (A) of the called
 * method. If object A is not used further inside the scope A can be garbage
 * collected, and if that happens object R becomes invalid (C++ memory has been
 * freed).
 *
 * This test checks whether memory management with respect to returning C++
 * references is done properly, such that objects still in use will not be
 * deleted.
