ARC1 Documentation
==================

This directory contains ARC documentation. The documentation has been divided into the following subfolders:

Directories:
------------

manuals		   - The documentation which should be part of the official ARC manuals. 
tech_doc	   - The official technical documentation.
tutorial	   - Any tutorial concerning the ARC software
templates	   - Templates of the documentation.
release_notes      - Official release notes of subsequent releases of ARC Nox series.
internal_notes	   - Deliverable design documents, old documentation or other internal notes not to be shown public.

All documents in manuals, tech_doc, tutorials must be kept up-to-date and integrated with the build system.
The ARC documentation package can be configured and build as a stand-alone package through the doc/configure.ac. 
Any new documentation should be added to this file and not to the top-level ../configure.ac

No document should be placed outside the folders above!
