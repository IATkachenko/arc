Making the Shepherd use Apache for http transfers
=================================================

Install ARC1 storage system as described in
arc1/doc/storage_system/prototype_installation_howto.txt

If not already installed, install Apache http server (http://httpd.apache.org/) 
and mod_python (http://www.modpython.org/) on the server where you run the 
Shepherd service.

Configuring Apache
-------------------

(/var/www/html/arc/shepherd/transfer may be replaced with anything you like as long as 
it's a directory under the apache DocumentRoot. Note that /var/www/html/arc and subdirs needs 
to be owned by the apache User:Group!)

Make sure the following lines are in the httpd.conf file (or some file read by httpd.conf):

	LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so
	# This will enable "slave mode", upload only to existing file,
	# file is removed when transfer starts
	<Directory /var/www/html/arc/shepherd/transfer>
   		SetHandler mod_python 
   		PythonHandler slave
	</Directory>

Make sure arc1/src/services/storage/shepherd/slave.py is in sys.path of mod_python. The 
easiest way to accomplish this is to simply copy arc1/src/services/storage/shepherd/slave.py 
to /var/www/html/arc/shepherd/transfer. The "slave mode" is described in 
arc1/src/services/httpd/README and is required for use with the Shepherd.

Configuring the Shepherd
------------------------

For a full sample configuration file for configuring the Shepherd with Apache, see 
arc1/src/services/storage/storage.service.apache.xml.example. Note specifically the sections
BackendClass and BackendCFG in the shepher service configuration:

    <BackendClass>storage.shepherd.hardlinkingbackend.ApacheBackend</BackendClass>
    <BackendCfg>
        <StoreDir>/var/spool/arc/shepherd_store</StoreDir>
        <TransferDir>/var/www/html/arc/shepherd/transfer</TransferDir>
        <!-- Change this prefix to the external interface of your machine -->
        <TURLPrefix>http://localhost:60080/arc/shepherd/transfer/</TURLPrefix>
        <!-- Apache User - name of user that httpd is run under -->
        <!-- This is usually 'apache', check httpd.conf if unsure -->
		<ApacheUser>apache</ApacheUser>
    </BackendCfg>
    
Here, the ApacheUser is the user that runs the Apache httpd deamon. We need this to set the right
group access for the storage files. Note that the user running arched needs to be in the same group
as the apache user. The Apache User and Group can be found in the httpd.conf file (and are both
usually named apache).

Now start up the Apache httpd ('service httpd start' in Fedora) and run arched as described in 
arc1/doc/storage_system/prototype_installation_howto.txt.
