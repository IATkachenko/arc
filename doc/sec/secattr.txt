   Security Attributes framework and it's usage for delegation restriction
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------


 Delegation framework in ARC1 is based on Security Attributes infrastructure.
There are 3 key components which make that infrastrcture:
  * Security Attributes themselves
  * Collectors of Security Attributes
  * Processors of Security Attributes

 Security Attributes represent security related information inside
HED framework and store information representing various aspects 
needed to perform authorization decison - identity of client, requested
action, targeted resource, constraint policies. Each kind of Security 
Attribute is represented by own class inherited from parent SecAttr class.

 Each Security Attribute stores it's information in internal format and 
provides it to external code in one of predefined formats. Currently
only supported format is Arc Policy/Request.

 Collectors of Security Attributes instantiate corresponding classes and
link them to Secuirity Attributes containers - MessageAuth and 
MessageAuthContext representing attributes per request and per session 
correspondingly. Current implementations of Security Attributes Collectors
are either integratd into existing MCCs or implemented as separate SecHandler
plugins. See Appendix A for available collectors and corresponding Security
Attributes. 

Note for service developers: Services may implement own authorization 
algorithms. But they may use Security Atributes as well by providing 
instances of classes inherited from SecAttr and running them through
either configured or hardcoded processors/PDPs (see below).

 Processors of Security Attributes are implemented as Policy Decision Point 
components. Currently there are 2 PDP components available:
  * Arc PDP makes use of Security Attributes containing identities of client,
resource and requested action. It evaluates either all or selected set 
of attributes against specified Policy documents thus making it possible
to enforce policies defined/selected by service providers. 
  * Delegation PDP is similar to Arc PDP except that it takes it's Policy
documents directly from Security Attributes. Differently from Arc PDP it 
is meant to be used for enforcing policies defined by client.

Appendix A. Avaialable Security Attributes

* TCP
 Information is collected inside TCP MCC. Security Attribute exports 
ARC Request with following attributes

  Element          AttributeId                                                       Content
 Resource          http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/localendpoint  service_ip[:service_port]   
 SubjectAttribute  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/remoteendpoint client_ip[:client_port]   

* TLS
 Information is collected inside TLS MCC. Security Attribute exports 
ARC Request with following attributes

  Element          AttributeId                                                       Content
 SubjectAttribute  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/tls/ca        Subject of signer of first certificate in client's chain
 SubjectAttribute  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/tls/chain     Subject of certificate in client's chain - multiple items
 SubjectAttribute  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/tls/subject   Subject of last certificate in client's chain
 SubjectAttribute  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/tls/identity  Subject of last non-proxy certificate in client's chain

* HTTP
 Information is collected inside TLS MCC. Security Attribute exports 
ARC Request with following attributes

  Element          AttributeId                                                       Content
 Resource  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/http/path   HTTP path without host and port part
 Action    http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/http/method           HTTP method 

* SOAP
 Information is collected inside TLS MCC. Security Attribute exports 
ARC Request with following attributes

  Element          AttributeId                                                       Content
 Resource  http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/soap/endpoint      WS-Addr To element
 Action    http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/soap/operation     SOAP top level element name without namespace prefix
 Context   http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/policy-arc/types/soap/namespace     Namespace of SOAP top level element

* Delegation
 This Security Attribute is collected by dedicated Security Handler plugin.
It extracts policy document stored inside X509 certificate proxy extension
as defined in RFC3820.  All certificates in a chain provided by client are 
examined.  Proxy certificates with id-ppl-inheritAll property are passed 
through and no policy is generated for them. From those with id-ppl-anyLanguage 
string content of ProxyPolicy element is extracted and converted into XML 
document. Then document is check to be of Arc Policy kind. If policy is
not recognized as Arc Policy procedure fails and that causes failure of
comunication. Proxies with other type of policies including id-ppl-independent
are not accepted and generate immediate failure.
