Because we are using SWIG for generate language bindings for libraries there should follow some guidelines at the implementation of class. These limitations comes indicated by limitations of SWIG C++ support:

1. Not use nested (struct or class definition in class) structures of classes,
2. Use operator overloading where it is absolutely necessary,
3. Multiple inheritance is not supported by some languages like Java, so minimaize the usage of this techniques.
