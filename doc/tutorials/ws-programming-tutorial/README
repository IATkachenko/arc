Tutorial on Programming Web Services with ARC-1
===============================================

A core technical advancement of ARC-1 over ARC-0 is the introduction
of web services for the communication of units that cooperate on the
grid. The concept established with ARC-1 is such generic, though, that
it can be used not only for the services that define the functionality
of the NorduGrid: anybody with an interest to offer anything with an
interface to the internet can use the technology behind ARC-1 to

 * setup a server that can be trusted by thei users
 * select (if wanted) the users with access to the resources
 * communiate with other services if needed

Technically, there is not much to learn for anybody who has done dynamic
web pages before. To build the LaTeX files, run ./autogen.sh && make .
