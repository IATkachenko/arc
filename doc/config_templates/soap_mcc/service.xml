            Either CACertificatePath or CACertificatesDir should be specified,
            if you would also verify the certificate which is used to sign
            the SOAP message, rather than just verify the validity of the 
            signature itself.
            
            Note you might think the CACertificatePath or CACertificatesDir is redundant 
            because there is the same configuration under tls mcc. 
            But the information is required here because it is better to seperate
            the configuration for transportation (TLS) layer and message (SOAP) layer.
