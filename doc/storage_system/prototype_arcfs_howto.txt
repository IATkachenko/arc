Installing ARC1 ARC FUSE file system from source
------------------------------------------------

Install ARC1 storage system as described in
arc1/doc/storage_system/prototype_installation_howto.txt

Additional dependencies:
fuse >= 2.7.3
fuse-python >= 0.2

Mounting ARCFS
--------------

Start up ARC1 storage server as described in
arc1/doc/storage_system/prototype_installation_howto.txt

   $ pwd
   /home/me/arc
   $ ln -s arc1/src/services/storage/fuse/arcfs.py arcfs.py
   $ mkdir mnt
   $ python arcfs.py ./mnt 
   
This mounts ARCFS in /home/me/arc/mnt, creates directory
/home/me/arc/fuse_transfer and a log file
/home/me/arc/arcfsmessages.

You can now make a collection
   
   $ mkdir -p mnt/home/me
   $ stat mnt/home/me
     File: `mnt/home/me'
     Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   directory
   Device: 19h/25d Inode: 3           Links: 2
   Access: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (  500/  me)   Gid: (  100/   users)
   Access: 1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000000 +0100
   Modify: 1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000000 +0100
   Change: 1970-01-01 01:00:00.000000000 +0100

Note that so far there is no security implemented, so
that all files have mode 0644, all collections have mode 0755,
everything is owned by the user that mounts the system.

Now you may want to have some entries in your collection
   $ cd mnt/home/me
   $ emacs -nw fish
   catfish
   $ cat fish
   catfish
   $ cp fish fisk2
   $ ls -la
   drwxr-xr-x 5 me users  0 1970-01-01 01:00 .
   drwxr-xr-x 3 me users  0 1970-01-01 01:00 ..
   -rw-r--r-- 1 me users  8 1970-01-01 01:00 fish
   -rw-r--r-- 1 me users 28 1970-01-01 01:00 fish~
   -rw-r--r-- 1 me users  8 1970-01-01 01:00 fish2

You probably want to remove that anoying emacs backup file
   
   $ rm fish~
   $ ls 
   fish  fish2

Maybe you want fish2 in a separate collection

   $ mkdir sea_creatures
   $ mv fish2 sea_creatures

Maybe you're not happy with the collection name

   $ mv sea_creatures creatures
   $ ls creatures
   fish2

What about moving the collection out of ARC storage?

   $ cd ../../..
   $ mv mnt/home/me/creatures .
   mv: cannot remove directory `mnt/home/me/creatures': Function
   not implemented

Oops. rmdir isn't implemented yet, so 'creatures' is now an empty
collection, but not removed it self

   $ find mnt/home/me/
   mnt/home/me/
   mnt/home/me/creatures
   mnt/home/me/fish



Unmounting ARCFS
----------------

To unmount, refer to fuse documentation. Usually you can do
   
   $ fusermount -u mnt

If this for some reason this doesn't work, you can do

   $ sudo umount -f mnt

or even

   $ sudo umount -l mnt

Now, remounting the system, everything should still be there:

   $ python arcfs.py ./mnt

   $ find mnt/home/me/
   mnt/home/me/
   mnt/home/me/creatures
   mnt/home/me/fish

   $ fusermount -u mnt


Current issues
------

delegation hanlding is not implemented yet

vim swap file is not removed if vim hasn't started writing to the swap
file before vim is closed.
