\subsection{arcsync}
\label{sec:arcsync}

It is advised to start every grid session by running \texttt{arcsync},
especially when changing workstations. The reason is that your job submission
history is cached on your machine, and if you are using ARC client
installations on different machines, your local lists of submitted jobs will be different. To synchronise
these lists with the information in the Information System, use the
\texttt{arcsync} \index{arcsync}\index{commands:arcsync} command.

   \texttt{-v, --version}&&print version information\\
   \texttt{-h, --help}&&print help page\\
\end{longtable}

The ARC client keeps a local list of jobs in the user's home
directory. If this file is lost,
corrupt, or the user wants to recreate the file on a different
workstation, the \texttt{arcsync} command will recreate this file from
the information available in the Information System.

Since  the  information  about  a job retrieved from a cluster can be slightly out of date if the user very recently
submitted or removed a job, a warning is issued when this command is run. The \verb#--force# option disables this warning.

If the job list is not empty when invoking syncronisation, the old jobs will be merged with the new jobs, unless the \verb#--truncate# option is given, in which case the job list will first be truncated and then the new jobs will be added.

\subsection{arcsub}\label{sec:arcsub}
The \texttt{arcsub}\index{arcsub}\index{commands:arcsub} command is the
most essential one, as it is used for submitting jobs to the Grid
resources. \index{submit job}\texttt{arcsub} matches user's job
description to the information collected from the Grid, and the
optimal site is being selected for job submission. The job description
is then being forwarded to that site, in order to be submitted to the
Local Resource Management System (LRMS), which can be, e.g., PBS or
Condor or SGE etc.

\begin{framed}
The \verb#-c# and \verb#-i# arguments accept meta-URLs of the format \texttt{GRID:URL}, where \texttt{GRID} indicates a Grid middleware flavour. Possible flavours are \texttt{ARC0}, \texttt{ARC1}, \texttt{CREAM} and \texttt{UNICORE}. For example, for index servers:
\begin{verbatim}
 ARC0:ldap://index.ng.org:2135/mds-vo-name=sweden,O=grid
 CREAM:ldap://cream.glite.org:2170/o=grid
\end{verbatim}
or clusters:

\verb# ARC0:ldap://ce.ng.eu:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=ce.ng.eu,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid#
\end{framed}

As a shorthand \texttt{-f} can be omitted if the job description file is put last on the commandline.

A simple \textit{"Hello World"} job could look like:

\begin{shaded}
 arcsub -c ARC0:ldap://grid.ng.org:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=grid.ng.org,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid -f job.jsdl
\end{shaded}

A user has to have valid credentials (see Section~\ref{sec:proxy}) and be authorised at the specified site. The test file \texttt{job.jsdl} is shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{framed}
   If a job is successfully submitted, a \textbf{job identifier}
   (\textit{job ID})\index{job ID} is printed to standard output.
\end{framed}

The job ID uniquely identifies the job while it is being executed. Job IDs
differ strongly between Grid flavours, but basically they have a form of a URL.
You should use Job ID as a handle to refer to the job when doing other
job manipulations, such as querying job status (\verb#arcstat#),
killing it (\verb#arckill#), re-submitting (\verb#arcresub#), or
retrieving the result (\verb#arcget#).

\begin{framed}
   Every job ID is a valid URL for the job session directory. You can
   always use it to access the files related to the job, by using data
   management tools (see Chapter~\ref{sec:dm}).
\end{framed}

The job description in xRSL or JSDL format can be given either as an
argument on the command line, or can be read from a file. Several jobs can be
requested at the same time by giving more than one filename
argument, or by repeating the \verb#-f# or \verb#-e# options. It is
possible to mix \verb#-e# and \verb#-f# options in the same
\texttt{arcsub} command.

The \verb#-c# option can be used to \textbf{force} a job to be
submitted to a particular site (cluster), or to reject submission to a
site. The matching is done by string match to the site name (i.e.
hostname) as defined in the Information System, or to an alias, as
defined in user configuration file (see
Section~\ref{sec:client.conf}).  The \verb#-c# option can be repeated
several times, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
    arcsub -c alias1 -c alias2 myjob.xrsl
\end{verbatim}
This will submit a job to either \verb#alias1# or
\verb#alias2#. To submit a job to any site except
\verb#badsite#, use \verb#-# sign in front of the name:
\begin{verbatim}
    arcsub -c -badsite myjob.xrsl
\end{verbatim}

If option \verb#-c# is not given, the \verb#arcsub# command locates the available sites by querying the
Information System. Default index services for the Information System are specified in the
configuration template distributed with the middleware, and can be overwritten both in the user's
configuration (see Section~\ref{sec:client.conf}) and from the command line using option
\verb#-i#. Different Grids use different notation for such index services.

If you would like to get diagnostics of the process of resource
discovery and requirements matching, a very useful option is
\verb#-d#. The following command:
\begin{verbatim}
    arcsub -d DEBUG myjob.xrsl
\end{verbatim}

will print out the steps taken by the ARC client to find the
best cluster satisfying your job requirements. A default value for
the debug level can be set in the user's configuration file.

It often happens that some sites that \verb#arcsub# has to contact
are slow to answer, or are down altogether. This will not prevent
you from submitting a job, but will slow down the submission. To
speed it up, you may want to specify a shorter timeout (default is
20 seconds) with the \verb#-t# option:
\begin{verbatim}
    arcsub -t 5 myjob.xrsl
\end{verbatim}

A default value for the timeout can be set in the user's configuration file.

The user interface transforms input job description into a format
that can be understood by the Grid services to which it is being
submitted. By specifying the \verb#-dumpdescription# option, such transformed
description is written to stdout instead of being submitted to the remote site.

The arcstat command returns the status of jobs submitted to the Grid. Then \texttt{-c} and \texttt{-i} accept arguments in the GRID:URL notation explained in the description of \texttt{arcsub}.

Different sites may report slightly different job states, depending on
the installed software version.% A summary of essential job
%states\index{job:states} is:

%  ---  Does the table below need updating? ---

\subsection{arccat}
\label{sec:arccat}

It is often useful to monitor the job progress by checking what it
prints on the standard output or error. The command \texttt{arccat}
\index{arccat}\index{commands:arccat} assists here, extracting the
corresponding information from the execution cluster and pasting it
on the user's screen. It works both for running tasks and for the
finished ones. This allows a user to check the output of the
finished task without actually retreiving it.

   \texttt{-h, --help}& & print help page\\
   Arguments:&&\\
   \texttt{job ...} && list of job IDs and/or jobnames\\
\end{longtable}

The \texttt{arccat} command can return the standard output of a job
(\texttt{-o} option), the standard error (\texttt{-e} option) and the
errors reported by the Grid Manager (\texttt{-l} option).


\subsection{arcget}
\label{sec:arcget}

To retrieve the results of a finished job, the \texttt{arcget}
\index{arcget}\index{commands:arcget} command should be used. It
will download the files specified by the \texttt{outputfiles}
attribute of job description to the user's computer.

   \texttt{-h, --help}& & print help page\\
   Arguments:&&\\
   \texttt{job ...} && list of job IDs and/or jobnames\\
\end{longtable}

Only the results of jobs that have finished can be downloaded. The job
can be referred to either by the \texttt{jobID} that was returned by
\texttt{arcsub} at submission time, or by its name, if the job
description contained a job name attribute.

\subsection{arckill}
\label{sec:arckill}

It happens that a user may wish to cancel a job. This is done by using
the \texttt{arckill} \index{arckill}\index{commands:arckill} command. A
job can be killed amost on any stage of processing through the Grid.

% 
% \textbf{{\$}\texttt{HOME/.ngjobs}} is a local list of the user's active

% and when it is removed from the remote site, it is removed from this
% list. This list is used as the list of all active jobs when the user
% specifies \verb#-a# option to the various ARC user interface commands.
% For information about how to reconstruct this file in case it is
% damaged or you relocate to a different workstation, see
% section~\ref{sec:arcsync} about the \texttt{arcsync} command.
% 
% \textbf{{\$}\texttt{HOME/.arc/history}} contains the \texttt{jobID}s of
% the jobs the user has submitted together with the time of
% submission. This file is purely informational.
