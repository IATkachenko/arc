.TH ngconfigtest 1 "@DATE@" "NorduGrid ARC @VERSION@" "NorduGrid ARC"
.SH NAME

ngconfigtest \- checks the arc.conf for inconsistencies, known problems
or (in a future development) just general bad taste.

.SH SYNOPSIS

ngconfigtest --printall

.SH DESCRIPTION

The motivation behind this little script was to have a repository for
automated tests on issues that came up on the NorduGrid developers
mailing list. As such this script indicates directories that are not
present or indicates that the cache directory does not reside on a file
system that knows how to implement UNIX locking properly. The tool is
supposed to help both the newbie and the experts to improve overall
reliability of the grid.

BECAUSE EVERY INSTALLATION OF ARC IS DIFFERENT THIS UTILITY ONLY SUGGESTS
WHAT COULD BE WRONG. SOMETIMES IT IS OVERRESTRICTIVE. AND SOMETIMES IT
CAN MISS SOME MISCONFIGURATION. NEVER TREAT RESULTS PRODUCED BY IT AS
ULTIMATE TRUTH.
