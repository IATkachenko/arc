.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
nordugridmap is usually run as a crontab entry in order to automatically generate mapfile(s). For configuration information consult tne Nordugruid ARC documentation and the arc.conf.template

Note that when parsing remote URLs such as https://, the target file is expected to 
contain a single column with DNs. This is because a remote location might not be 
aware of any local unix users (as a local gridmap file would).

When parsing a local grid-mapfile (the one defined with file://), if a line of the file contains a userid in the second column,
then the nordugridmap utility will IGNORE the mapped_unixid field in the [vo] configuration block for that specific line of the file.
In other words, userid defined in grid-mapfiles take precedence on what is defined as mapped_unixid in arc.conf .
