Client for ISIS (Information Indexing service)

Using this client one can put and get registrations to/from the ISIS.

Mostly for testing.

The test ISIS client is for the following operations:
    Query - for querying remote ISIS
        attributes: The query string.
    Register - for sending test Register messages
        attributes:
            The following set of information for register.
            - A ServiceID and an Endpoint reference.
            - A ServiceID, an Endpoint reference and a Service type.
            - A ServiceID, an Endpoint reference, a Service type and an Expiration period.
    RemoveRegistration - for sending test RemoveRegistration messages
        attributes: The ServiceID for remove.
    (The GetISISList operation will be used in every other cases impicitly.)

    It is also possible to define the BootstrapISIS with the -b or --bootstrap command line option.

    For testing purposes it's also possible to define the isis url directly with the -i or --isis option.
    If there is such an option defined the GetISISList operation will be skipped even if there is also
    a BootstrapISIS defined.

    If -n or --neighbors options are used without any parameters, then the neighbors of the ISIS or the
    BootstrapISIS will be also shown.

    Usage:
        isistest -m Query "query string"
        isistest -m Register "ServiceID1,EPR1" "ServiceID2,EPR2,Type" "ServiceID3,EPR3,Type,ExpTime"
        isistest -m RemoveRegistration "ServiceID1" "ServiceID2"
        etc.

    Examples:
        isistest -m Register "Srv_ID1,EPR1"
        isistest -m Register "Srv_ID1,EPR1,org.nordugrid.tests.echo,PT1M"
        isistest -m Query "/RegEntry/MetaSrcAdv/ServiceID[text()=\"Srv_ID1\"]"
        isistest -m RemoveRegistration "Srv_ID1"

        isistest -b https://your.domain.com/infosys -m RemoveRegistration "Srv_ID1"

        isistest -i https://your.domain.com/infosys -m Query "/RegEntry"
