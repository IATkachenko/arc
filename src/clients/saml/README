ARC SAML Services client
========================


Description
-----------

This is a client tool to communicate to SAML-based VOMS services.


Implementation notes
--------------------

The tool requires 3rd-party xmlsec1 libraries, as well as common ARC libraries found in

  src/hed/libs


Build notes
-----------

Due to the dependencies above, it is not feasible to build ARC
SAML Services client in a manner independent from the rest of ARC
code. In order to build it, obtain full ARC source code tree and run
in its root:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make install
