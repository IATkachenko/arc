ARC job management command line interface
=========================================


Description
-----------

This is a command line user interface (client) for computational job
submission and management to ARC, CREAM and EMI ES enabled computing services.
For ARC, both Grid Manager (GridFTP) and A-REX compute elements are supported.

The following commands are implemented:

 o arcsub     - job submission
 o arcstat    - job information
 o arcinfo    - resource information
 o arcget     - job retrieval
 o arckill    - job cancellation
 o arcclean   - job clean-up
 o arccat     - job output capture
 o arcresub   - job re-submission
 o arcrenew   - remote credentials renewal
 o arcsync    - syncronisation of user job list
 o arcresume  - job resumption
 o arctest    - functionality testing


Implementation notes
--------------------

The commands are built upon the ARC SDK, in particular the libarccompute library
with source code located in

  src/hed/libs/compute

which in turn makes use of ARC Client Components (ACC) located in

  src/hed/acc

In addition, job management client requires data handling methods from
the libarcdata library with source code located in

  src/hed/libs/data

Additional command line user interface tools exist for credential
handling and basic file handling, located respectively in 

  src/clients/credentials
  src/clients/data


Build notes
-----------

Due to complex dependencies above, it is not feasible to build ARC job
management client in a manner independent from the rest of ARC
code. In order to build ARC clients, obtain full ARC source code tree
and run in its root:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make install


Installation and configuration notes
------------------------------------

Depending on the operating system and distributor, ARC job management
client is available in a variety of packages:

 o Linux: rpm, deb, binary tarball
 o MS Windows: installer
 o Mac OS X
 o Source tarball

Please follow specific for each case installation instructions,
offered by the distributor.

Client configuration file template can be found in

  src/clients/client.conf

and is installed by default in /etc/arc/client.conf to define common
configuration parameters for all users at a machine. Individual user
configuration files have the same format and should be placed manually
in

  ~/.arc/client.conf

If necessary, a different configuration can be specified from the
command line.


Documentation
-------------

Installation guide and client tools manual (complete with
confiduration manual) can be found at the NorduGrid Web site, are
distributed with the NorduGrid ARC documentation package, and are also
available from the NorduGrid code repository.

Each command line tool comes complete with Linux man pages and short
help.
