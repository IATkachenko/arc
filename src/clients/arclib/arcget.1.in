.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcget
command downloads the results after a job has completed on an ARC
enabled computing resource. Only the results of jobs that have
finished can be downloaded. The job can be referred to either by the
jobid that was returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname the results of all those jobs are
downloaded. If the
.B -joblist
option is used the list of jobids is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B -all
option, the results of all active jobs are downloaded.

The
.B -cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The
.B -status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.

For each job that is downloaded a subdirectory will be created in the
download directory that will contain the downloaded files.

If the download was successful the job will be removed from the remote
cluster unless the
.B -keep
option was specified.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B .arc/config.xml
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC configuration file.

.TP
.B .arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed
from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B -all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
