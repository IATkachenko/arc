.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcstat
command gives the status of a job submitted an ARC enabled
resource. The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was
returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname the status of all those jobs are
shown. If the
.B --joblist
option is used the list of jobs is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B --all
option, the status of all active jobs will be shown. If the
.B --long
option is given more detailed information is given.

The
.B --cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option. The
.B --status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.

The
.B arcstat
command locates the available clusters by querying information index
servers. Which servers to query can be specified by giving the
.B --index
option to the command. See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option.

Also in this case the
.B --long
option can be used to obtain more detailed information.

Previously the
.B arcstat
command was also used to query information of clusters and/or index servers.
This functionality have been moved to the new command
.B arcinfo
.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed
from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.

.TP
.B ARC_LOCATION
The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not
specified the install location will be determined from the path to the
command being executed, and if this fails a WARNING will be given stating the
location which will be used.

.TP
.B ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
The location of ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple
locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The
default location is \fB$ARC_LOCATION\fR/lib/arc (\\ in Windows).
