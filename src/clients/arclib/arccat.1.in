.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arccat
command performs the cat command on the selected log file. Only jobs that have
are presently running or have finished (i.e. not queueing) can be targeted . 
The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname all those jobs are removed. If the
.B -joblist
option is used the list of jobids is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B -all
option, the selected log of all not queueing jobs can be printed.

The
.B -cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The
.B -status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.

option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands.
