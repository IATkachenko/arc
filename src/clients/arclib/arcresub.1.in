.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcresub
command is used for resubmitting jobs on grid enabled computing
resources to the same or new resources. The job can be referred to
either by the jobid that was returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname all those jobs will be resubmitted.

Upon resubmission of a job the corresponding job description will be
fetched from the local joblist file along with the checksum of local
input files. If the checksums does not match the current ones the
job no longer remains the same job an will therefore not be
resubmitted.

In case the job description is not found in the joblist, it will
be retrieved from the cluster holding the job. This description
however might differ from the one originally used to submit the job,
since both the submission client and the cluster can have made
modifications to the job description.

Upon resubmision the job will receive a new jobid. Hence the old
jobid will also be stored in the local joblist file enabling
future back tracing of the resubmitted job.

The name of the local joblist file can used specified by the
.B --joblist
option. By specifying the
.B --all
option, all active jobs appearing the in joblist file will be
resubmitted.

The
.B --cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters to be
resubmitted. See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option.
The
.B --qluster
option can be used to force the jobs to be resubmitted to a particular
cluster, or to reject resubmission to a particular cluster. Againg see
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option.
The
.B --status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.
Which servers to query can be specified by giving the
.B --index
option to the command. See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option.

The
.B --same
option can be used to force jobs to be resubmitted to the same cluster
as where they were initial run.
If the old job was successfully killed the job will be removed from the
remote cluster unless the
.B --keep
option was specified.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed
from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.
