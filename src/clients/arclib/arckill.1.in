.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arckill
command kills a running job on an ARC enabled resource. The job can be
referred to either by the jobid that was returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname all those jobs are killed. If the
.B -joblist
option is used the list of jobids is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B -all
option, all jobs can be killed.

The
.B -cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The
.B -status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.

If the job was successfully killed the job will be removed from the
remote cluster unless the
.B -keep
option was specified.

.SH FILES

.B -all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands.
