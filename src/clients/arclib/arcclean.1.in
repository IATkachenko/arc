.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcclean
command removes a job from the remote cluster. Only jobs that have
finished can be removed. The job can be referred to either by the
jobid that was returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname all those jobs are removed. If the
.B -joblist
option is used the list of jobids is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B -all
option, all active jobs can be removed.

The
.B -cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The
.B -status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.

The
.B -force
option removes the job from your local list of jobs even if the job
can not be found in the remote clusters information system.

.SH FILES

.B -all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands.
