.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcsub
command is used for submitting jobs to grid enabled computing
resources.

The
.B -cluster
option can be used to force the job to be submitted to a particular
cluster, or to reject submission to a particular cluster. The
.B -cluster
option can be repeated several times.

.IR Examples :
.IP "\fBarcsub -c ARC0:ldap://grid.tsl.uu.se:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=grid.nbi.dk,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid -c ARC0:ldap://grid.tsl.uu.se:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=grid.tsl.uu.se,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid\fR ..."
submit the job to either grid.nbi.dk or grid.tsl.uu.se
.IP "\fBarcsub -c -ARC0:ldap://grid.tsl.uu.se:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=grid.quark.lu.se,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid -c -ARC0:ldap://grid.tsl.uu.se:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=grid.nbi.dk,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid\fR ..."
don't submit the job to grid.quark.lu.se or grid.nbi.dk
.LP

The job description that describes the job can be given either on the
command line using the \fB-jobdescrstring\fR option or be read from a
file using the \fB-jobdescrfile\fR option. Several jobs can be
requested at the same time by giving more than one
\fB-jobdescrstring\fR or \fB-jobdescrfile\fR option. It is also
possible to mix \fB-jobdescrstring\fR and \fB-jobdescrfile\fR options
in the same \fBarcsub\fR command.

The user interface transforms the job description into a format that
can be understood by the grid-manager to which it is being
submitted. By specifying the \fB-dumpdescription\fR option the
transformed job description is written to stdout instead of being
submitted to the remote cluster.

If the job is successfully submitted a jobid is printed to
stdout. This jobid uniquely identifies the job while it is being
executed. If the
.B -joblist
option is given the jobid is also written to a file with the specified
filename. This file can later be used with the
.B -joblist
option of the other user interface commands.

The
.B arcsub
command locates the available clusters by querying information index
servers. Which servers to query can be specified by giving the
.B -indexurl
option to the command. The url to the index server should be given in
the format

.B FLAVOR:protocol://hostname[:port]/path

Several indices can be specified by repeating the \fB-indexurl\fR
option:

.B arcsub
.B -indexurl
.I url1
.B -indexurl
.I url2
...

.SH FILES

.TP
.B .arc/config.xml
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC configuration file.

.TP
.B .arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed
from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B -all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.
