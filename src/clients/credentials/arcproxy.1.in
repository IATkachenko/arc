location of generated credentials proxy file
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
location of X509 certificate file
.TP
\fB\-K\fR
location of private key file
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
path to trusted certificate directory, only needed for voms client functionality
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
path to voms server configuration file, only needed for voms client functionality
.TP
\fB\-S\fR
voms<:command>. Specify voms server. 
              :command is optional, and is used to ask for specific attributes(e.g: roles)
              command option is:
              all --- put all of this DN's attributes into AC; 
              list ---list all of the DN's attribute,will not create AC extension; 
              /Role=yourRole --- specify the role, if this DN 
                               has such a role, the role will be put into AC 
              /voname/groupname/Role=yourRole --- specify the vo,group and role if this DN 
                               has such a role, the role will be put into AC 

.TP
\fB\-G\fR
use GSI communication protocol for contacting VOMS services

.TP
\fB\-O\fR
use GSI proxy (RFC 3820 compliant proxy is default)

.TP
\fB\-I\fR
print all information about this proxy. 
              In order to show the Identity (DN without CN as subfix for proxy) 
              of the certificate, the 'trusted certdir' is needed.

.TP
\fB\-U\fR
Username to myproxy server.

.TP
\fB\-L\fR
url of myproxy server, e.g. knowarc1.grid.niif.hu:7512. If the port number has not

.TP
\fB\-M\fR
command to myproxy server. The command can be PUT and GET.
              PUT/put -- put a delegated credential to myproxy server; 
              GET/get -- get a delegated credential from myproxy server, 
              credential (certificate and key) is not needed in this case; 
              myproxy functionality can be used together with voms functionality.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR
constraints of proxy certificate. Currently following constraints are supported:

\fBvalidityStart=time\fR - time when certificate becomes valid. Default is now.

\fBvalidityEnd=time\fR - time when certificate becomes invalid. Default is 43200 (12 hours) from start.

\fBvalidityPeriod=time\fR - for how long certificate is valid. Default is 43200 (12 hours).

\fBvomsACvalidityPeriod=time\fR - for how long the AC is valid. Default is the same as validityPeriod.

\fBproxyPolicy=policy content\fR - assigns specified string to proxy prolicy to limit it's functionality.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
prints short usage description
.PP
If not specified location of certificate, key and proxy will be taken from content of environment
