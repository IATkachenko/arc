.SH NAME

cache-clean \- Administration tool for the A-REX cache.

.SH SYNOPSIS

cache-clean [-h] [-s] [-m NN -M NN] [-E N] [-D debug_level]
  [ -c <arex_config_file> | <dir1> [<dir2> [...]] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cache-clean
is a tool for administrators of ARC server installations to safely
remove A-REX cache data and to provide an overview of the contents of
the cache.  It is used by the A-REX to automatically manage cache
contents.

There are two modes of operation - printing statistics and deleting files.
If
.B -s
is used, then statistics are printed on each cache. If
.B -m
and
.B -M
are used then files in each cache are deleted if the free space on 
the file system is less than that given by
.B -m,
in the order of least recently accessed, until the free space is equal
to what is specified by
.B -M.
If
.B -E
is used, then all files accessed less recently than the given time are
deleted.
.B -E
can be used in combination with 
.B -m
and
.B -M
but deleting files using
.B -E
is carried out first. If after this the cache free space is still less
than that given by
.B -m
then cleaning according to those options is performed. Cache directories are given by
.B dir1, dir2..
or taken from the config file specified by
.B -c
or the ARC_CONFIG environment variable.

.B -h
- print short help

.B -s
- print cache statistics, without deleting anything. The output displays
for each cache the number of deletable (and locked) files, the total size of
these files, the percentage usage of the file system in which the cache is
stored, and a histogram of access times of the files in the cache.

.B -m
- the minimum free space (as % of the file system) at which to start cleaning

.B -M
- the minimum free space (as % of the file system) at which to stop cleaning

.B -E
- files accessed less recently than the given time period will be
deleted. Example values of this option are 1800, 90s, 24h,
30d. The default when no suffix is given is seconds.

.B -D
- debug level. Possible values are FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO,
VERBOSE or DEBUG. Default level is INFO.

.B -c
- path to an A-REX config file, xml or ini format

This tool is run periodically by the A-REX to keep the size of each
cache within the limits specified in the configuration file. Therefore
cleaning should not be performed manually, unless the cache size needs
to be reduced temporarily. For performance reasons it may however be
desirable to run cache-clean independently on the machine hosting the
cache file system, if this is different from the A-REX host. The most
useful function for administrators is to give an overview of the
contents of the cache, using the
.B -s
option.

Within each cache directory specified in the configuration file, there is
a subdirectory for data (data/) and one for per-job hard links (joblinks/).
See the A-REX Administration Guide for more details.
.B cache-clean
should only operate on the data subdirectory, therefore when giving
.B dir
arguments they should be the top level cache directory.
.B cache-clean
will then automatically only look at files within the data directory.


.SH EXAMPLE

.B cache-clean -m20 -M30 -E30d -D VERBOSE -c /etc/arc.conf

Cache directories are taken from the configuration file
.B /etc/arc.conf
and all cache files accessed more than 30 days ago are deleted. Then
if the free space in a cache is below 20%, data is deleted until the
free space reaches 30%. Verbose debug output is enabled so information
is output on each file that is deleted.
