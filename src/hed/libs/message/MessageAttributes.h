  //! A class for storage of attribute values.
  /*! This class is used to store attributes of messages. All
    attribute keys and their corresponding values are stored as
    strings. Any key or value that is not a string must thus be
    represented as a string during storage. Furthermore, an attribute
    is usually a key-value pair with a unique key, but there may also
    be multiple such pairs with equal keys.

    The key of an attribute is composed by the name of the Message
    Chain Component (MCC) which produce it and the name of the
    attribute itself with a colon (:) in between,
    i.e. MCC_Name:Attribute_Name. For example, the key of the
    "Content-Length" attribute of the HTTP MCC is thus
    "HTTP:Content-Length".

    There are also "global attributes", which may be produced by
    different MCCs depending on the configuration. The keys of such
    attributes are NOT prefixed by the name of the producing
    MCC. Before any new global attribute is introduced, it must be
    agreed upon by the core development team and added below. The
    global attributes decided so far are:
    \li \c Request-URI Identifies the service to which the message
    shall be sent. This attribute is produced by e.g. the HTTP MCC
    and used by the plexer for routing the message to the
    appropriate service.
