Folder for ARC Client Components (ACC)

ACCs are the plugins used by the client to interface to different 
grid flavours. One folder exists for each supported grid flavour 
and each grid flavour should implement specialized classes of the 
following base classes (located in src/hed/libs/client)

o TargetRetriever
o JobController
o Submitter

The plugins are loaded by appropriate "umbrella" classes such 
as the JobSupervisor and TargetGenerator which resolves issues
about which plugins (i.e flavour) to load depending on the 
command in question
