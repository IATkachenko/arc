/*************/
test_client_with_delegation_sechandler.cpp
This file shows how to add a security handler into client 
configuration so that a proxy can be delegated onto a 
delegation service (ARC delegation service).
The delegation process is completed together with the first
soap operation. Once the delegation has been successful, the 
successive soap operation will not need to do delegation.

/*************/
test_delegation_client.cpp
This file shows how to call a specific client interface (ClientX509Delegation) for
delegating a proxy onto delegation service (ARC delegation service
or gridsite delegation service).

In case of delegating a proxy onto gridsite service, since the CREAM service
is designed to be physically hosted together with the gridsite delegation service, and 
CREAM service (maybe) shares the same respository of proxies with gridsite delegation
service; and CREAM service particularly has an interface to consume the DelegationID from
client, therefore the ClientX509Delegation class can be explicitly called to interact
with CREAM service and gridsite delegation service.

In case of delegating a proxy onto ARC delegation service, the ARC delegation service
is not designed as a service that is by default known by (and hosted together with) 
the ARC services; also ARC services themselves have no interface to consume the DelegationID
from client, the  ClientX509Delegation should not be explicitly called to interact with
ARC services and ARC delegation service. Instead, it is called by the delegation security 
handler ("delegator" and "delegatee" roles) to delegate (by "delegator") a proxy onto an ARC delegation
service, and then acquire (by "delegatee") a proxy from the ARC delegation service.
Since everything is done by the security handler, nothing (almost) is needed to change for
the client/service code. So the delegation process generally applies to ARC services.
