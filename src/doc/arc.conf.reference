## This is the arc.conf REFERENCE DOCUMENT defining the configuration blocks and 
## variables for the ARC services.
##
## WARNING: this file will not work as a configuration template!
## There are out-of-the-box minimal configuration templates provided.
## NEVER USE THIS DOCUMENT AS A CONFIGURATION FILE!
##
## The arc.conf configuration file consists of blocks like
## [common], [grid-manager], [gridftpd], [cluster], [infosys], etc..
##
## A block is identified by its blockname. A blockname consists of
## keywords and optionally block identifiers: [queue/short] here 'queue' is
## a keyword while 'short' is an identifier. Block names must be UNIQUE. 
## A block starts with a unique [blockname] and ends with
## the next [blockname] directive. 
## A block may have sub-blocks e.g. [grid-manager/wsinterfaces] or 
## [infosys/glue2/ldap]. 
##
## Configuration blocks contain (variable, variable value) pairs following the syntax: 
## variable=the variable value(s) come(s) in single line and everything is part of the value till the end of the line.
## Note that quotes around the variable value(s) MUST not be used any longer.
## Commented out or unset configuration options (variables) take their default values!
## Some parts of the configuration file are order-dependent: there can be blocks or 
## configuration variables that may require other blocks be defined earlier. On the other hand, 
## the order of the variables within a specific block is irrelevant.
## Note that the arc.conf is CASE-SENSITIVE!
##
## A block configures an ARC service, a service interface, a utility or a subsystem. 
## enabling (turning on) a functionality, a service or an interface requires the presence of the 
## appropriate configuration block. To disable a service or an interface, simply comment out
## the related arc.conf block (you may need to rerun the corresponding startup script).
##
## As an example, in order to set up a minimalistic ARC CE with a WS-interface 
## you need to configure at least the [common],[grid-manager],[lrms],[gridmanager/wsinterfaces],
## [infosys],[infosys/glue2],[cluster] and [queue/name] blocks.
##
## As another example, when the ARC CE is configured according to the "classic" setup with 
## gridftp-based jobsubmission interface and LDAP infosys publishing the nordugrid schema, 
## the following blocks are needed: [common], [grid-manager], [gridftpd], [gridftpd/jobs],
## [infosys], [infosys/ldap], [infosys/ldap/bdii],[infosys/nordugrid],[cluster] and [queue/queue_name]
##
## Developers: This file is parsed by configuration validation scripts and so
##   it is important that it follows the agreed syntax: For each block or
##   option please add explanatory text with two ## followed by a space at the
##   beginning of the line and then an example with a single # and no spaces at
##   the beginning of the line. These examples are used as reference parameters
##	 for the block and variable names!
##
## Below we give a detailed description of all the configuration options of the
## different configuration blocks. Every configuration variable is described 
## in a dedicated block with the following reference notation:
##
## variable_name variable_value [variable_values]  - Here comes the explanation
## of the variable. The explanation is followed by the special keywords "mandatory" or 
## "multivalued" in a separate line to indicate that a parameter is mandatory (within a given block)
## or can be set multiple times (multivalued). Missing such keywords mean the variable is 
## optional and can only occur once in the arc.conf. By default the arc.conf parameters are optional 
## and single-valued. For some variables only a fix set of values are allowed. These are 
## listed in a separate line after the "allowedvalues" keyword. 
## The default of every parameter is explicitly given in the "default:" line. 
## The last line of the paragraph is always a valid example preceded by a single #
## multivalued
## mandatory
## type: e.g. string (types to be agreed later)
## allowedvalues: 12 34 56
## default: 34 
#variable_name=56
###########################################################################


### The [common] block ##############################################
## Common configuration affecting all ARC components, usually related to networking or security or service behaviour.
## The common block parameters may be overridden by the specific sections of the components later. 
## The [common] always appears at the beginning of the config file. The parameters set within this block
## are available for all the other blocks thus shared by the different components of ARC.
## TODO add loglevel, reportperfnumbers as new config parameters to this block
#[common]

## hostname - The FQDN of the frontend on which the ARC services are deployed.
## mandatory
## default: as a safety fallback solution, the return value of the shell command hostname -f is used
#hostname=myhost.org
## CHANGE: modified semantics

## enable_perflog_reporting yes/no - Turns on/of the performance metrics collection and reporting 
## built-in feature of the various ARC components. 
## allowedvalues: expert-debug-on no
## default: no
#enable_perflog_reporting=expert-debug-on
## CHANGE: new parameter

## perflogdir path - The directory containing the performance metric files.
## default: var/log/arc/perfdata
#perflogdir=var/log/arc/perfdata
## CHANGE: new parameter

## http_proxy  url - The http proxy server.
## default: not set
#http_proxy=proxy.mydomain.org:3128
## CHANGE: moved here from the [grid-manager] block

### X509 related parameters
## x509_host_key - (previously x509_user_key) Server credential location. Sets the full path to the host private key.
## These variables are similar to the GSI enviroment variable X509_USER_KEY
## If indicated, the variable can be set individually for each service/component in the corresponding block.
## default: /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
#x509_host_key=/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
## CHANGE: renamed 

## x509_user_cert - (previously x509_user_cert) Server credential location. Sets the full path to the host public certificate.
## These variables are similar to the GSI environment variable X509_USER_CERT
## If indicated, the variable can be set individually for each service/component in the corresponding block.
## default: /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
#x509_host_cert=/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
## CHANGE: renamed as host_cert

## x509_cert_dir - Location of trusted CA certificates.
## This variable is similar to the GSI enviroment variable X509_CERT_DIR
## If indicated, the variable can be set individually for each service/component in the corresponding block.
## default: /etc/grid-security/certificates
#x509_cert_dir=/etc/grid-security/certificates

### VOMS related parameters
## x509_voms_dir path - the path to the directory containing *.lsc files
## needed for checking validity of VOMS extensions. 
## default: /etc/grid-security/vomsdir
#x509_voms_dir=/etc/grid-security/vomsdir

## voms_processing keyword - Defines how to behave if errors in VOMS AC processing detected.
##   relaxed - use everything that passed validation.
##   standard - same as relaxed but fail if parsing errors took place and
##              VOMS extension is marked as critical. This is a default.
##   strict - fail if any parsing error was discovered.
##   noerrors - fail if any parsing or validation error happened.
## This parameter can also be used in [grid-manager] and [griftpd] blocks.
## allowedvalues: relaxed standard strict noerrors
## default: standard
#voms_processing=standard

## voms_trust_chain - Define the DN chain that the host services trust when the
## voms AC from peer voms proxy certificate is parsed and validated.
## CHANGE: DELETED should be removed from code and config!

### Coarse-grained initial authorization
## gridmap path - The location of the so-called gridmap file. The gridmap file contains a list of
## grid identities (DNs) with their local unix ID mappings. If the gridmap option is configured
## then its content is used as a coarse-grained authorization rule by the ARC services
## which most of the cases implies that the user with the DN is granted access.
## DNs listed in the gridmapfile are also published as authorized users in the nordugrid information schema.
## This variable may be set individually for certain ARC services in their corresponding blocks.
## default: /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
#gridmap=/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
##
##
### end of the [common] block ##############################################


### The [common/mapping] block ##############################################
## This block defines the grid-identity --- local unix identity mapping rules used by 
## various ARC components. 
#[common/mapping]
## CHANGE: This is a new block

## gridmap path - The gridmap file location. Preferably should be set in the [common] block but 
## may be set here as well.
## default: /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
#gridmap=/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile

## unixmap [unixname][:unixgroup] rule - A more sophisticated way to map
##  Grid identity of client to local account. If client matches 'rule'
##  it's assigned specified unix identity or one generated by rule.
##  Mapping commands are processed sequentially and processing stops
##  at first successful one (like in [authgroup] section). For possible rules
##  read "ARC Computing Element. System Administrator guide" manual. All
##  rules defined in [authgroup] section can be used. There are also additional
##  rules which produce not only yes/no result but also give back user and
##  group names to which mapping should happen. The way it works is quite
##  complex so it is better to read full documentation.
##  For safety reasons if sophisticated mapping is used it is better to
##  finish mapping sequence with default mapping to nonexistent or safe
##  account.
## multivalued: yes
## default: not set
#unixmap=nobody:nogroup all
## ARC ships with LCMAPS plugin that can be enabled with following unixmap configuration.
## For more information about configuring LCMAPS itself see section 'Using LCAS/LCMAPS' in the ARC 
## Computing Element System Administrator Guide).
#unixmap=* mapplugin 30 /usr/libexec/arc/arc-lcmaps %D %P liblcmaps.so /usr/lib64 /etc/lcmaps/lcmaps.db arc

## unixgroup authgroup rule - Mapping rule only for users belonging to
##  specified authorization 'authgroup'. It is similar to an additional filter
##  for unixmap command which filters out all users not belonging to specified
##  authorization group. Only rules which generate unix user and group names
##  may be used in this command. Please read "ARC Computing Element System
##  Administrator Guide" for more information.
## multivalued: yes
## default: not set
#unixgroup=users simplepool /etc/grid-security/pool/users

## unixvo userlist_name rule - Mapping rule only for users belonging to 
## specified VO defined via the [userlist/name] block.
## Only rules which generate unix identity name may be used in this command.
## Please read "ARC Computing Element. System Administrator Guide" for more
## information. This command is similar to 'unixgroup' described above and
## exists for convenience for setups which base mapping on VOs users belong to.
## multivalued: yes
## default: not set
## TODO: Suggestion: consider to rename 'unixvo' option to something like 'unixmap_userlist' to eliminate this VO-based possible misunderstood naming
#unixvo=ATLAS unixuser atlas:atlas
## CHANGE: modified option. It uses the name from the [userlist/name] block 
##
##
### end of the [common/mapping] block ##############################################


### The [lrms] block ##############################################
## This block specifies the characteristics of the Local Resource Manager System (batch system) 
## sitting beneath the ARC CE. This is the block that contains all the lrms-specific parameters and information.
## Configuration values in this block are available for A-REX, the backends, accounting and infosys
## ARC subsystems. ARC support the most common LRMS flavours. 
## For detailed description of recommended LRMS setups for ARC please refer to ARC CE sysadmin guide:
## http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-ce-sysadm-guide.pdf
#[lrms]
## CHANGE: This is a new block. Contains parameters previously set in [common], [infosys], [cluster], [queue]

## lrms lrmstype [queue] - Sets the type of the LRMS (queue system) and optionally the default queue name.
## ONLY ONE LRMS IS ALLOWED. MULTIPLE lrms ENTRIES WILL TRIGGER UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR.
##
## For lrmstype, the following values can be chosen:
##    fork    - simple forking of jobs to the same node as the server
##    sge     - (Sun/Oracle) Grid Engine
##    condor  - Condor
##    pbs     - PBS (covers all the PBS flavours e.g. OpenPBS, PBSPro, ScalablePBS, Torque)
##    lsf     - LSF
##    ll      - LoadLeveler
##    slurm   - SLURM
##    boinc   - Boinc
##    slurmpy - new generation SLURM scripts (provide access to slurm via ssh too)
##    lsfpy   - new generation of LSF scripts (provide access to LSF via ssh too)
##    sceapi  - The Chinese HPC Grid
## PBS has many flavours, ARC currenly supports OpenPBS, PBSPro, ScalablePBS
## and Torque (the official name for ScalablePBS). There is no need to specify
## the flavour or the version number of the PBS, simply write 'pbs'. Similarly,
## there is no need to specify (Sun/Oracle) Grid Engine versions and flavours.
## 
## The optional "queue" parameter specifies the default Grid queue of the
## LRMS. Jobs will be submitted to this queue if they do not specify queue
## name in job description. Queue name must match one of the [queue/queue_name] blocks.
##
## mandatory: yes
## allowedvalues: fork sge condor pbs lsf ll slurm boinc slurmpy lsfpy sceapi
## default: not set
#lrms=pbs gridlong
#lrms=slurm
## CHANGE: new lrmstype values added (slurmpy, lsfpy, sceapi). FIX annoying SLURM spelling!!!

## lrmsconfig text - An optional free text field to describe the configuration of your
## Local Resource Management System (batch system). The value is published in the infosys.
## default: not set
#lrmsconfig=single job per processor
## CHANGE: moved here from the [cluster] block

## defaultmemory number - The LRMS memory request of job to be set by A-REX if
## a user submits a job without specifying how much memory should be used.
## The order is: xrsl -> defaultmemory -> nodememory -> 1GB. 
## This is the amount of memory (specified in MB) that a job will request.
## default: not set
#defaultmemory=512
## CHANGE: moved here from the [cluster] block

### PBS options: set these only in case of lrms=pbs 
## pbs_bin_path path - The path to the qstat,pbsnodes,qmgr etc PBS binaries,
## no need to set if PBS is not used
## default: not set
#pbs_bin_path=/usr/bin

## maui_bin_path path - Sets the path of the maui commands like showbf.
## default: not set
#maui_bin_path=/usr/local/bin

## pbs_log_path path - The path of the PBS server logfiles which are used by A-REX to determine
## whether a PBS job is completed. If not specified, A-REX will use qstat for that.
## default: not set
#pbs_log_path=/var/spool/pbs/server_logs

## pbs_dedicated_node_string string - (previously dedicated_node_string) The string which 
## is used in the PBS node config to distinguish the grid nodes from the rest. 
## Suppose only a subset of nodes are available for grid jobs, 
## and these nodes have a common "node property" string,
## this case the string should be set to this value and only the
## nodes with the corresponding  "pbs node property" are counted as grid enabled
## nodes. Setting the dedicated_node_string  to the value of the "pbs node
## property" of the grid-enabled  nodes will influence how the totalcpus, user
## freecpus is calculated. You don't need to set this attribute if your cluster
## is fully available for the grid and your cluster's PBS config does not use
## the "node property" method to assign certain nodes to grid queues. You
## shouldn't use this config option unless you make sure  your PBS config makes
## use of the above described setup.
## default: not set
#pbs_dedicated_node_string=gridnode
## CHANGE: renamed. moved here from [cluster] 

### Condor options: set these only in case of lrms=condor
## condor_bin_path  path - Path to Condor binaries. Must be set if Condor
## is used.
## default: not set
#condor_bin_path=/opt/condor/bin

## condor_config path - Full path to Condor config file. Must be set if Condor
## is used and the config file is not in its default location
## (/etc/condor/condor_config or ~/condor/condor_config).
## The full path to the file should be given.
## default: not set
#condor_config=/opt/condor/etc/condor_config

## condor_rank ClassAd_float_expression - If you are not happy with the way Condor picks nodes when
## running jobs, you can define your own ranking algorithm by optionally
## setting the condor_rank attribute. condor_rank should be set to a
## ClassAd float expression that you could use in the Rank attribute
## in a Condor job description.
## default: not set
#condor_rank=(1-LoadAvg/2)*(1-LoadAvg/2)*Memory/1000*KFlops/1000000

## condor_requirements string - It needs to be defined for each Condor queue. 
## Use this option to determine which nodes belong to the current queue.  
## The value of 'condor_requirements' must be a valid constraints string
## which is recognized by a condor_status -constraint '....' command. It can
## reference pre-defined ClassAd attributes (like Memory, Opsys, Arch, HasJava,
## etc) but also custom ClassAd attributes.  To define a custom attribute on a
## condor node, just add two lines like the ones below in the `hostname`.local
## config file on the node:
##   NORDUGRID_RESOURCE=TRUE
##   STARTD_EXPRS = NORDUGRID_RESOURCE, $(STARTD_EXPRS)
## A job submitted to this queue is allowed to run on any node which satisfies
## the 'condor_requirements' constraint.  If 'condor_requirements' is not set,
## jobs will be allowed to run on any of the nodes in the pool. When configuring
## multiple queues, you can differentiate them based on memory size or disk
## space, for example.
## TODO: wrongly implemented in the backends: queue-level values are ignored!
## default: not set
#condor_requirements=(OpSys == "linux" && NORDUGRID_RESOURCE && Memory >= 1000 && Memory < 2000)

## default: not set
#sge_root=/opt/n1ge6

## sge_cell name - The name of the SGE cell to use. This option is only necessary
## in case SGE is set up with a cell name different from 'default'
## default: default
#sge_cell=default

## sge_qmaster_port port - The SGE port options should be used in case SGE
## command line clients require SGE_QMASTER_PORT and SGE_EXECD_PORT environment
## variables to be set. Usually they are not necessary.
## default: default
#sge_qmaster_port=536

## sge_execd_port port - The SGE port options should be used in case SGE

### The [lrms/ssh] block ##############################################
## This sub-block configures the ssh environment for remote batch management.
## Currently the python slurm and lsf batch modules are able to utilize remote ssh.
#[lrms/ssh]
## CHANGE: new sub-block
## TODO: indicate which parameter is mandatory from this sub-block

## remote_host hostname - Define the remote cluster frontend machine which contains
## session, cache and runtime directories and where jobs should be submitted to.
## default: not set
#remote_host=myremotehost.org

## private_key path - Location of the private key which should be used establish
## connection to the machine specified by the 'remote_host' attribute.
## default: TODO
#private_key=/etc/grid-security/hostkey-priv.pem

## remote_user user - User on remote cluster which should be used for mounting

### end of [lrms/ssh] block #####################################################


### The [userlist/name] (previously [vo]) blocks #####################################################
## The [userlist/name] blocks are used to define userlists and configure how those are 
## generated by the nordugridmap utility, including the optional user mapping information.
## The userlist is identified with the generated file that is stored in the "outfile".
## Please note that behaviour of the nordugridmap external utility can be further modified by
## the optional [nordugridmap] block (see next block).
## Note that the [userlist/name] block by itself does not affect authorization. In order to define
## auth rules userlists can be referenced within the [authgroup] blocks by the userlist=name parameter.
## Also, the generated "outfile" can be used via the 'file' auth rule of the [authgroup] block.
#[userlist/biousers]
## CHANGE: new blockname that better reflects the purpose of the config block. This block is not defining any VO!

## id blockid - specifies the unique configuration block id (this does not affect nordugridmap utility)
## CHANGE: DELETED  should be removed from code and config now that the userlist blocks have unique names

## name userlist_name - (previously vo) This optional parameter specifies the name of the userlist.
## This must be the same as the one in the [userlist/name] block name.
## default: not set
#name=biousers
## CHANGE: renamed from "vo"

## outfile path - (previously file) The full path of the GENERATED file that contains the 
## userlist (with optional mapping info). 
## If the same file specified as output for different [userlist/name] blocks
## then nordugridmap will automatically merge entries following the order of the blocks.
## default: the value of the gridmap parameter from [common] or /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
#outfile=/etc/grid-security/lists/atlas-users
## CHANGE: renamed from "file"

## source url - the URL of the VO database which is used to generate the userlist.
## The nordugridmap will use this URL to automatically generate and keep
## up-to-date userlist (mapfile) specified by the 'outfile' attribute.
##
## url is a multivalued attribute, several sources can be specified 
## and all the users from those sources will be merged into the same file. 
## The source URLs are processed in the given order.
##
## Currently supported URL types are:
##    http(s)://  - URL to plain text file. File should contain a list
##                 of DNs with optional issuer certificate authority DN
##                 (see require_issuerdn): "user DN" ["issuer DN"]
##    voms(s)://  - URL to VOMS-Admin interface
##    ldap://     - expect LDAP-schema formatted VO Group
##    file://     - local file (stand-alone or dynamicaly generated by
##                 nordugridmap). File should contain a list of DNs with
##                 optional mapped unixid: "user DN" [mapped user ID]
##                 Result of optional mapped unixid processing depend
##                 on mapuser_processing option settings.
##    userlist:// - reference to another [userlist/name] configuration block
##    nordugrid   - add NorduGrid VO members
##
## You can use either userlist:// or file:// entries to specify dependencies
## between [userlist/name] blocks, but using userlist:// is a recommended way.
##
## For each separate source URL it is possible to override some parameters
## value. You can use the following syntax to perform this:
##    source=URL < parameter1=value1 parameter2=value2
## You can override the following parameters:
##    mapped_unixid       for http(s),voms(s),ldap and file URLs
##    cache_enable        for http(s),voms(s),ldap and file URLs
##    voms_method         for voms(s) URLs
##    mapuser_processing  for file URLs with mapped_unixid='<unixid>' overrided
##                        (control mapped_unixid overriding behaviour for URL)
## multivalued
## mandatory

## CHANGE: MODIFIED options: edg-mkgridmap source option is removed (obsolete technology);  vo source option is renamed as userlist.

## mapped_unixid unixid - The local UNIXID which is optionally used in the generated
## outfile by the nordugridmap utility.
##
## If any of the sources have already provided mapping information (file://
## or userlist://) behavior depends on 'mapuser_processing' from the [nordugridmap] block:
##    mapuser_processing = 'overwrite': ignore already provided mapping and
##                         apply mapped_unixid for all sources
##    mapuser_processing = 'keep': apply mapped_unixid only for sources that
##                         does not already has mapping information
##
## If the 'mapped_unixid' config parameter is not specified or has empty value, 
## then behavior depends on the value of 'allow_empty_unixid' from the [nordugridmap] block:
##   If the allow_empty_unixid = 'yes': then empty value will be used for mapped_unixid
##                         which means that nordugridmap will generate only
##                         the list of DNs without mapping (consider using
##                         mapuser_processing='overwrite' along with this
##                         option or sources that does not provide previously
##                         defined mapping information)
##   If the allow_empty_unixid = 'no': then nordugridmap will skip users without mapping information 
##						(if no mapping information provided by sources)
## default: ""
#mapped unixid=
#mapped_unixid=gridtest
## CHANGE: check that the empty value works the same way as missing parameter. set the default to ""

## voms_fqan_map fqan unixid - The local UNIXID which is used to map voms(s)
## sources with specific FQAN given.
##
## Several voms_fqan_map can be specified for a [userlist/name] block.
## For each voms(s) sources in [userlist/name] block and every voms_fqan_map record
## separate source record will be automatically generated with mapped_unixid
## overwritten to specified one.
##
## Sources are generated in a given voms_fqan_map order. Original voms(s) source
## URL are processed LAST.
##
## This allows to simplify configuration, especially in redundancy cases when
## several VOMS servers are used for the same VO.
## multivalued: yes
## default: not set
#voms_fqan_map=/atlas/Role=VO-Admin atlasadmin
#voms_fqan_map=/atlas/Role=production atlasprod

## require_issuerdn yes/no - YES would map only those DNs obtained from the urls...
## CHANGE: DELETED. no valid use-case for this feature any longer. 

## filter  ACL string - An ACL filter for the nordugridmap utility. Multiple
## allow/deny statements are possible. The fetched DNs are filtered against
## the specified rules before they are added to the generated outfile.
##
## * can be used as a wildcard. You may run the nordugridmap with the --test
## command line option to see how the filters you specified work.
##
## If at least one allow filter is specified implicit deny is used at the end
## of ACL. If only deny filters are present - implicit allow used at the end.
## multivalued: yes

### end of the [nordugridmap] block ##################################


### The [authgroup/name] (previously [group]) blocks ######################################
## These configuration blocks contain authorization rules. These rules determine which
## authorization group a user belongs to. Then, the access control of ARC services are 
## implemented via specifying the [authgroup/name] to which certain permissions are granted.
## For more info please read "Security Framework of ARC" at
## http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-security-documentation.pdf
## The authgroup should not be mistaken for a virtual organisation (VO). 
## An authgroup may match a single VO if only a single check (rule) on VO membership is perfomed. 
## It is however more common to allow multiple VOs in a single authgroup. 
## 
## IMPORTANT: Rules in an authgroup are processed in their order of appearance.
## The first matching rule decides the membership of the user to the authgroup
## being evaluated and the processing STOPS within that authgroup. This does not mean that
## the same user is not processed for the next authgroup: all [authgroup/name] blocks are 
## evaluated, even if a user already has a match with one of the earlier groups. 
##
## There are positively and negatively matching rules. 
## If a rule is matched positively then the user tested is accepted
## into the respective group and further processing is stopped. Upon a
## negative match the user would be rejected for that group - processing
## stops too. The sign of rule is determined by prepending the rule with
## '+' (for positive) or '-' (for negative) signs. '+' is default and can
## be omitted. A rule may also be prepended with '!' to invert result of rule,
## which will let the rule match the complement of users. That complement
## operator ('!') may be combined with the operator for positive or negative
## matching.
##
## All the objects used in the rules (e.g. userlists) MUST be defined before it may be used. 
## In this respect the arc.conf is ORDER SENSITIVE.
#[authgroup/allowedusers]
## CHANGE: renamed the block. 

## name authgroup_name - This optional parameter specifies the name of the authgroup. 
## This must be the same as the one in the [authgroup/name] block name. 
## If this parameter not set then the name of the subblock is used instead, for example [authgroup/allowedusers]
## default: not set
#name=allowedusers

## subject certificate_subject - Rule to match specific subject of user's
## X.509 certificate. No masks, patterns and regular expressions are allowed.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#subject=/O=Grid/O=Big VO/CN=Main Boss
#subject=/O=Grid/O=Big VO/CN=Deputy Boss

## file path - Processes a list of DNs stored in an external file and adds those to 
## the authgroup. 
## multivalued
## default: not set
#file=/etc/grid-security/local_users
#file=/etc/grid-security/atlas_users
## CHANGE: Redefined semantics. Mentions only a limited capability of this parameter: the external file should only contain DNs, no complex rules. No need to change the code.

## voms vo group role capabilities - Match VOMS attribute in user's credential.
##  Use '*' to match any value. 
## multivalued
## default: not set
#voms=nordugrid Guests * *
#voms=atlas students prodman *

## authgroup group_name [group_name ...] - (previously group) Match user already belonging to one
## of specified authgroups. The authgroup referred here must be defined earlier in
## configuration file. Multiple authgroup names may be specified for this rule.
## That allows creating hierarchical structure of authorization groups like
## 'clients' are those which are 'users' and 'admins'.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#authgroup=local_admins
#authgroup=local_admins remote_users
## CHANGE: renamed 

## userlist ulist_name [ulist_name ...] - (previously vo) Match user belonging to ulist_name defined
## in an earlier [userlist/ulist_name] block. Multiple userlist names are allowed for this rule.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#userlist=biousers
## CHANGE: renamed

## plugin timeout path [argument ...] - Run external executable or
##  function from shared library. Rule is matched if plugin returns 0.
##  In arguments following substitutions are supported:
##   %D - subject of certicate
##   %P - path to proxy
## ARC ships with LCAS plugin that can be enabled with following plugin configuration.
## For more information about configuring LCAS itself see section 'Using LCAS/LCMAPS' in the ARC 
## Computing Element System Administrator Guide).
## multivalued
## default: not set
#plugin=10 /usr/libexec/arc/arc-lcas %D %P liblcas.so /usr/lib64 /etc/lcas/lcas.db

## lcas library directory database - Call LCAS functions to check rule.
## CHANGE: DELETED. The same can be done with the "plugin" parameter

## remote URL ... - Check user's credentials against remote service. Only
## CHANGE: DELETED.  Feature is not used for ages. Code simplification.

## all - Matches any user identity. This command requires no arguments but
## still should be written as all="" for consistency.
## default: not set
#all=""
#TODO: all= VS all=""

#norootpower=yes

## watchdog yes/no - Specifies if additional watchdog processes is spawned to restart
## main process if it is stuck or dies.
## allowedvalues: yes no
## default: no
#watchdog=no

## loglevel level - (previously debug) Set loglevel of the arched daemon hosting A-REX service
## between 0 (FATAL) and 5 (DEBUG). Defaults to 3 (INFO).
## allowedvalues: 0 1 2 3 4 5

## CHANGE: DELETED. not really used. hide it from the arc.conf template. Can stay as a "hidden feature".

## fixdirectories yes|missing|no - Specifies during startup A-REX should
## create all directories needed for it operation and set suitable default
## permissions. If "no" is specified then A-REX does nothing to prepare its
## operational environment. In case of "missing" A-REX only creates and
## sets permissions for directories which are not present yet.  For "yes"
## all directories are created and permisisons for all used directories are
## set to default safe values.
## allowedvalues: yes missing no
## default: yes
#fixdirectories=yes

## controldir path - The directory of the A-REX's internal job log files. 
## The directory is not needed on the nodes. <must be set>. 
## mandatory
## default: not set
#controldir=/var/spool/nordugrid/jobstatus

## sessiondir path [drain] - the directory which holds the sessiondirs of the grid jobs.
## Multiple session directories may be specified.
## In this case jobs are spread evenly over the session directories.
## If sessiondir=* is set, the session directory will be spread over the
## ${HOME}/.jobs directories of every locally mapped unix user. It is preferred
## to use common session directories. The path may be followed by "drain", in
## which case no new jobs will be assigned to that sessiondir, but current jobs
## will still be processed and accessible. <sessiondir must be set>
## multivalued
## mandatory
## default: not set
#sessiondir=/scratch/grid
#sessiondir=*

## defaultttl [ttl [ttr]] - The ttl parameter sets the time in seconds for how long a job session
## directory will survive after job execution has finished. If not specified
## the default is 1 week. The ttr parameter sets how long information about a job will be kept
## after the session directory is deleted. If not specified, the ttr default is one month.
## default:  604800 2592000
#defaultttl=2592000

## allowedvalues: yes no
## default: yes
#shared_filesystem=yes
## TODO Florido: clarify the mount path on the node vs. frontend.

## scratchdir path - The path on computing node to move session directory to before
## execution. If defined should contain the path to the directory on the
## computing node which can be used to store a jobs' files during execution.
## Sets the environment variable RUNTIME_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR. If the variable is not set,
## then the session dir is not moved before execution. Don't set this parameter unless 
## you want to move the sessiondir to scratchdir on the node. 
## default: not set
#scratchdir=/local/scratch/

## shared_scratch path - The path on frontend where scratchdir can be found. If
## defined should contain the path corresponding to that set in scratchdir as
## seen on the frontend machine. Sets the environment variable
## RUNTIME_FRONTEND_SEES_NODE.
## default: not set
#shared_scratch=/mnt/scratch

## tmpdir path - A temporary directory used by A-REX.
## default: /tmp
#tmpdir=/tmp

## runtimedir path - The directory which holds the runtimeenvironment scripts,
## should be available on the nodes as well! The runtimeenvironments are
## automatically detected and advertised in the information system.
## default: not set
#runtimedir=/SOFTWARE/runtime

## maxjobs number1 number2 number3 number4 - Specifies maximum allowed number of jobs.
## number1 - jobs which are not in FINISHED state (jobs tracked in RAM)
## number2 - jobs being run (SUBMITTING, INLRMS states)
## number3 - jobs being processed per DN
## number4 - jobs in whole system
## A parameter set to -1 means no limit.
## default: not set
#maxjobs=10000 10 2000 -1
## CHANGE: Explicitly indicate "no limit" with -1. "Missing number" should not be allowed.

## maxrerun number - Specifies how many times job can be rerun if it failed in LRMS.
## This is only an upper limit, the actual rerun value is set by the user in his xrsl.
## default: 5

## enables a callout feature of A-REX: every time job goes to 'state' A-REX 
## will run 'plugin_path' executable. Options consist of key=value pairs separated
## by ','. Possible keys are: 
##    timeout - wait for result no longer that 'value' seconds, (timeout= can be omitted).
##    onsuccess,onfailure,ontimeout - what to do if plugin exited with exit
## code 0, not 0, timeout achieved. Possible actions are:
## pass - continue executing job,
## fail - cancel job,
## log - write to log fail about problem and continue executing job.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#statecallout=ACCEPTED timeout=10 /usr/libexec/arc/bank %C/job.%I.local %S

## arc-vomsac-check: a statecallout plugin shipped with ARC: it's purpose is to enforce
## per-queue access policies based on VOMS attributes present in user's
## proxy-certificate. Plugin should be run before job enters the cluster.
## It requires 2 arguments: path to job .local file and path to credentials file.
## Enforced per-queue access policies are configured with 'ac_policy' option
## in the [queue/name] configuration block.
## CHANGE: renamed from authplugin

## wakeupperiod time - Specifies how often A-REX checks for new jobs
## arrived, job state change requests, etc. That is responsiveness of
## A-REX. 'time' is time period in seconds. Default is 3 minutes.
## Usually no need to change this parameter because important state changes
## are also triggering out-of-schedule checks.
## NOTE: This parameter does not affect responsiveness of backend scripts -
## especially scan-*-job. That means that upper estimation of time for
## detecting job finished executing is sum of responsiveness of backend
## script + wakeupperiod.
## default: 180
#wakeupperiod=180

## infoproviders_timelimit seconds - (previously infoproviders_timeout) Sets the 
## execution time limit of the infoprovider scripts started by the A-REX. 
## Infoprovider scripts running longer than the specified timelimit are 
## gracefully handled by the grid-manager (the behaviour depends on 
## the state of the system) 
## Increase this value if you have many jobs in the controldir and
## infoproviders need more time to process.
## default: 1200
#infoproviders_timelimit=1200
## CHANGED: rename, infoproviders_timelimit, move to grid-manager block

## pidfile path - Specify location of file containing PID of daemon process.
## default: /var/run/arched-arex.pid
#pidfile=/var/run/arched-arex.pid

## mail email_address - Specifies the email address from where the notification mails are sent
## default: root@hostname
#mail=grid.support@somewhere.org
CHANGE: implement a default! in the format of root@localhost. 

## gnu_time path - The gnu time command
## default: /usr/bin/time
#gnu_time=/usr/bin/time

## nodename path - The command to obtain hostname of computing node.
## default: /bin/hostname
#nodename=/bin/hostname

## helper user executable arguments - By enabling this parameter A-REX will 
## run an external "helper" program under the user useraccount. The program will be
## kept running, every time the executable finishes it will be started again.
## As a limitation, currently only '.' is supported as username, which corresponds 
## to the user running A-REX. 
## default: not set
#helper=. /usr/local/bin/myutility

## helperlog path - Configuration option to specify the location of log for helpers.
## default: var/log/arc/job.helper.errors
#helperlog=var/log/arc/job.helper.errors
## CHANGE: new parameter, check the default.

## x509_user_cert - Location of credentials for service.
## CHANGE: DELETED. no need to separately set these for grid-manager. The common block is enough. remove from arc.conf but can be kept as a secret option in the code.

## x509_user_key - Location of credentials for service.
## CHANGE: DELETED. no need to separately set these for grid-manager. The common block is enough. remove from arc.conf but can be kept as a secret option in the code.

### The [grid-manager/cache] block #########################################
## This subblock enables and configures the cache functionality of A-REX. 
## A-REX can cache input files downloaded as part of stagein proces of grid jobs 
## so that subsequent jobs requiring the same file don’t have to downloading it again. 
## The cached file will be symlinked (or copied) into the session directory of the job.
## To disable to cache functionality simply comment out the [grid-manager/cache] config block.
## For more information about the cache functionality of A-REX consult the sysadmin guide.
#[grid-manager/cache]
## CHANGE: new block

## logfile path - (previously cachelogfile) sets the filename where output of the cache-clean

#logfile=/tmp/cache-clean.log
## CHANGE: renamed as logfile

## cacheloglevel level - (previously cacheloglevel) specifies the level of logging by the cache-clean

## CHANGE: renamed as loglevel

## cachedir cache_path [link_path] - Specifies a directory to store cached
## data. Multiple cache directories may be specified. Cached data will be distributed 
## evenly over the caches.
## Optional link_path specifies the path at which the cache_path is accessible on
## computing nodes, if it is different from the path on the A-REX host.
## Example: cache=/shared/cache /frontend/jobcache
## If "link-path" is set to '.' files are not soft-linked, but copied to session
## directory. If a cache directory needs to be drained, then cachedir
## should specify "drain" as the link path, in which case no new files will be
## added to the cache.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#cachedir=/scratch/cache
#cachedir=/fs1/cache drain

## remotecachedir cache_path [link_path] - specifies caches which are under
## CHANGE: DELETED, this feature is not in use any longer. remove parameter and clean code

## cachesize max min - Specifies high and low watermarks for space used
## by cache, as a percentage of the space on the file system on which
## the cache directory is located. When the max is exceeded, files will
## be deleted to bring the used space down to the min level. It is a
## good idea to have the cache on its own separate file system. If cachesize
## is not specified the cache will not be cleaned by A-REX.
## default: do not clean
#cachesize=80 70

## cachelifetime time - If cache cleaning is enabled by setting cachesize,
## files accessed less recently than the given time period will be deleted. 
## Example values of this option are 1800, 90s, 24h, 30d. When no suffix is given the unit is seconds.
## default: not set
#cachelifetime=30d

## cacheshared yes|no - specifies whether the caches share a filesystem with
## other data. If set to yes then cache-clean calculates the size of the cache
## instead of using filesystem used space.
## allowedvalues: yes no
## default: no
#cacheshared=yes

## cachespacetool path [options] - specifies an alternative tool to "df" that
## cache-clean should use to obtain space information on the cache file system.
## The output of this command must be "total_bytes used_bytes". The cache
## directory is passed as the last argument to this command.
## default: not set
#cachespacetool=/etc/getspace.sh

## cachecleantimeout time - the timeout in seconds for running the cache-clean
## tool. If using a large cache or slow file system this value can be
## increased to allow the cleaning to complete. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

## A subsystem called DTR (Data Transfer Reloaded) is responsible for collecting input data
## for a job before submission to the LRMS, and for staging out data
## after the job has finished. Automagic data staging of A-REX is a very powerful feature,
## disabling this functionality (by commenting out the subblock) is not recommended. 
#[grid-manager/data-staging]
## CHANGE: rename the block as [grid-manager/data-staging]

## loglevel - (previously debug) Sets the log level for transfer logging in job.id.errors files,
## between 0 (FATAL) and 5 (DEBUG). Default is to use value set by loglevel option in

## CHANGE: renamed, new default value chosen

## usehostcert yes/no - Whether the A-REX host certificate should be used for
## communication with remote hosts instead of the users' proxies.
## allowedvalues: yes no
## default: no
#usehostcert=yes

## maxtransfertries number - the maximum number of times download and upload will
## be attempted per job (retries are only performed if an error is judged to be temporary)
## default: 10
#maxtransfertries=20

## securetransfer yes|no - if data connection allows to choose use
## secure|non-secure data transfer. Currently only works for gridftp.
## allowedvalues: yes no
## default: no
#securetransfer=no 

## passivetransfer yes|no - If yes, gridftp transfers are passive. Setting
## this option to yes can solve transfer problems caused by firewalls.
## allowedvalues: yes no 
## default: yes
#passivetransfer=yes
## CHANGE: new default: yes

## globus_tcp_port_range port_range - In a firewalled environment 
## the software which uses GSI needs to know what ports are available. 
## If not set a random port is selected.

## speedcontrol min_speed min_time min_average_speed max_inactivity - specifies
## how slow data transfer must be to trigger error. Transfer is cancelled if
## speed is below min_speed bytes per second for at least min_time seconds,
## or if average rate is below min_average_speed bytes per second, or no data
## was transferred for longer than max_inactivity seconds. 
## Value of zero turns feature off.
## default: 0 300 0 300
#speedcontrol=0 300 0 300
## CHANGE: missing parameter (speedcontrol="") should also turn the feature off, not just zero value.

## maxdelivery number - Maximum number of concurrent file transfers, i.e. active
## transfers using network bandwidth. This is the total number for the whole
## system including any remote staging hosts.
## default: 10

##   dn - each job is assigned to a share based on the DN of the user sumbitting the job.
##   voms:vo - each job is assigned to a share based on the VO specified in the proxy. 
##   voms:role - each job is assigned to a share based on the role specified in the first 
## attribute found in the proxy. 
##   voms:group - each job is assigned to a share based on the group specified in the 
## first attribute found in the proxy. 
## In case of the voms schemes, if the proxy is not a VOMS proxy, then a default share is used.
## default: not set
#sharepolicy=voms:role

#copyurl=gsiftp://example2.org:2811/data/ /data/

## linkurl url_head local_path [node_path] - Identical to 'copyurl', configures DTR 
## so that for certain URLs files won't be downloaded or copied (in case of copyurl), 
## but soft-link will be created. The 'local_path'
## specifies the way to access the file from the frontend, and is used
## to check permissions. The 'node_path' specifies how the file can be
## accessed from computing nodes, and will be used for soft-link creation.
## If 'node_path' is missing - 'local_path' will be used.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#linkurl=gsiftp://somewhere.org/data /data

## The replicas will be tried in the order specified by preferredpattern variable.
## default: not set
#use_remote_acix=https://cacheindex.ndgf.org:6443/data/index
## CHANGE: rename

## preferredpattern pattern - specifies a preferred pattern on which
## to sort multiple replicas of an input file. It consists of one or
## more patterns separated by a pipe character (|) listed in order of
## preference. Replicas will be ordered by the earliest match. If the
## dollar character ($) is used at the end of a pattern, the pattern
## will be matched to the end of the hostname of the replica.
## default: not set
#preferredpattern=srm://myhost.ac.uk|.uk$|ndgf.org$|badhost.org$

## central_logfile - A file in which all data staging messages from every job
## will be logged (in addition to their job.id.errors files). If this option is
## not present or the path is empty the log file is not created. Note this file
## is not automatically controlled by logrotate.
#central_logfile=/var/log/arc/datastaging.log

## The following 4 options are used to configure multi-host data staging.
##
## deliveryservice URL - The URL to a data delivery service which can perform remote
## data staging
## default: not set
#deliveryservice=https://myhost.org:443/datadeliveryservice

## localdelivery yes/no - If any deliveryservice is defined, this option determines
## whether local data transfer is also performed.
## allowedvalues: yes no
## default: no
#localdelivery=yes

## remotesizelimit size - Lower limit on file size (in bytes) of files that remote
## hosts should transfer. Can be used to increase performance by transferring

## available for every information model/schema representation.

### The [cluster] block ###################################################
## This block describes the cluster characteristics of a Computing Element.
## The information specified here is mostly used by the Infosys ARC component.
#[cluster]

## alias text - An arbitrary alias name of the cluster, optional.
## default: not set
#cluster_alias=Big Blue Cluster in Nowhere

## hostname  fqdn - Set the FQDN of the frontend.
## default: uses the value of the [common] block
#hostname=myhost.org

## interactive_contactstring url - the contact URL for interactive logins, set this
## if the cluster supports some sort of grid-enabled interactive login (gsi-ssh),
## multivalued
## default: not set
#interactive_contactstring=gsissh://frontend.cluster:2200

## comment text - Free text field for additional comments on the cluster in a single
## line, no newline character is allowed!
## default: not set
#comment=This cluster is specially designed for XYZ applications: www.xyz.org

## cluster_location formatted_string - The geographical location of the cluster, preferably
## specified as a postal code with a two letter country prefix
## default: not set
#cluster_location=DK-2100

## cluster_owner text - It can be used to indicate the owner of a resource, multiple
## entries can be used
## multivalued
## default: not set
#cluster_owner=World Grid Project
#cluster_owner=University of NeverLand

## authorizedvo  vo_name - This attribute is used to advertise which VOs are authorized
## on the cluster.
## Add only one VO for each authorizedvo entry. Multiple VOs in the same line
## will cause errors.
## These entries will be shown in all GLUE2 AccessPolicy and MappingPolicy 
## objects, that is, they will apply for all Endpoints(Interfaces) and all 
## Shares(currently queues).
## The information is also published in the NorduGrid schema.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#authorizedvo=developer.nordugrid.org
#authorizedvo=community.nordugrid.org

## clustersupport email - This is the support email address of the resource.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#clustersupport=grid.support@mysite.org
#clustersupport=grid.support@myproject.org

## homogeneity True/False - Determines whether the cluster consists of identical NODES with
## respect to  cputype, memory, installed software (opsys). The frontend is NOT
## needed to be homogeneous with the nodes. In case of inhomogeneous nodes, try
## to arrange the nodes into homogeneous groups assigned to a queue and use
## queue-level attributes. 
## False will trigger multiple GLUE2 ExecutionEnvironments to be published
## if applicable.
## allowedvalues: True False
## default: True
#homogeneity=True

## architecture string - Sets the hardware architecture of the NODES. The "architecture"
## is defined as the output of the "uname -m" (e.g. i686). Use this cluster
## attribute if only the NODES are homogeneous with respect to the architecture.
## Otherwise the queue-level attribute may be used for inhomogeneous nodes. If
## the frontend's architecture agrees to the nodes, the "adotf" (Automatically
## Determine On The Frontend) can be used to request automatic determination.
## default: not set
#architecture=adotf

## opsys formatted_string - This multivalued attribute is meant to describe the operating system
## of the computing NODES. Set it to the opsys distribution of the NODES and not
## the frontend! opsys can also be used to  describe the kernel or libc version
## in case those differ from the originally shipped ones. The distribution name
## should be given as distroname-version.number, where spaces are not allowed.
## Kernel version should come in the form kernelname-version.number.
## If the NODES are inhomogeneous with respect to this attribute do NOT set it on
## cluster level, arrange your nodes into homogeneous groups assigned to a queue
## and use queue-level attributes.
## opsys will be used to fill GLUE2 OSName, OSVersion and OSFamily unless
## these values are explicitly defined. See below for their usage.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#opsys=Linux-2.6.18
#opsys=glibc-2.5.58
#opsys=CentOS-5.6

## nodecpu formatted_string - This is the cputype of the homogeneous nodes. The string is
## constructed from the /proc/cpuinfo  as  the value of "model name"  and "@" and
## value of "cpu MHz". Do NOT set this attribute on cluster level if the NODES
## are inhomogeneous with respect to cputype, instead arrange the nodes into
## homogeneous groups assigned to a queue and use queue-level attributes. Setting
## the nodecpu=adotf will result in Automatic Determination On The Frontend,
## which should only be used if the frontend has the same cputype as the
## homogeneous nodes.
## default: not set
#nodecpu=AMD Duron(tm) Processor @ 700 MHz

## nodememory number - This is the amount of memory (specified in MB) on the node
## which can be guaranteed to be available for the application. Please note
## in most cases it is less than the physical memory installed in the nodes.
## Do NOT set this attribute on cluster level if the NODES are inhomogeneous
## with respect to their memories, instead arrange the nodes into homogeneous
## groups assigned to a queue and use queue-level attributes.
## default: not set
#nodememory=512

## benchmark name value - This optional multivalued attribute can be used to
## specify benchmark results on the cluster level. Use this cluster attribute
## if only the NODES are homogeneous with respect to the benchmark performance.
## Otherwise the similar queue-level attribute should be used. Please try to
## use standard benchmark names, if possible.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#benchmark=SPECINT2000 222
#benchmark=SPECFP2000 333

## middleware string - The multivalued attribute shows the installed grid software on
## the cluster, nordugrid and globus-ng  is automatically set, no need to specify
## middleware=nordugrid or middleware=globus
## multivalued
## default: not set
#middleware=my grid software

## nodeaccess inbound/outbound - Determines how the nodes can connect to the internet. 
## Not setting anything means the nodes are sitting on a private isolated network. 
## "outbound" access means the nodes can connect to the outside world while 
## "inbound" access means the nodes can be connected from outside. 
## inbound & outbound access together means the nodes are sitting on a fully open network.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#nodeaccess=inbound
#nodeaccess=outbound

## localse url - This multivalued parameter tells the BROKER that certain URLs (and
## locations below that) should be considered "locally" available to the cluster.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#localse=gsiftp://my.storage/data1/
#localse=gsiftp://my.storage/data2/

## gm_mount_point - this is the same as the "path" from the [gridftpd/jobs]
## CHANGE: DELETED. hardcode "jobs" in the infoproviders.

## gm_port - this is the same as the "port" from the [gridftpd] block. The
## CHANGE: DELETED. hardcode 2811 in the infoproviders.

## cpudistribution formatted_string - This is the CPU distribution over nodes
## given in the form: ncpu:m where
##   n is the number of CPUs per machine
##   m is the number of such computers
## Example: 1cpu:3,2cpu:4,4cpu:1 represents a cluster with
## 3 single CPU machines, 4 dual CPU machines, one machine with 4 CPUs.
## default: not set
#cpudistribution=1cpu:3,2cpu:4,4cpu:1

### end of the [cluster] block #####################


### The [queue/name] blocks #######################################
## Each grid-enabled queue on the cluster should be represented and described 
## by a separate queue block. The queue_name should be used as a label in the block name.
## In case of fork, or other LRMSes with no queue names, just use any unique string.
## A queue can represent a PBS/LSF/SGE/SLURM/LL queue, a SGE pool, a Condor
## pool or a single machine in case 'fork' type of LRMS. 
## This block describes the queue characteristics.
#[queue/gridlong]

## name  string - Sets the name of the grid-enabled queue. It MUST match the name
## label from the queue block header.
## default: not set
#name=gridlong

## homogeneity True/False - determines whether the queue consists of identical NODES with
## respect to  cputype, memory, installed software (opsys).
## In case of inhomogeneous nodes, try to arrange the nodes into homogeneous
## groups and assigned them to a queue.
## Possible values: True,False, the default is True.
## allowedvalues: True False
## default: True
#homogeneity=True

## scheduling_policy MAUI/FIFO - This optional parameter tells the scheduling policy of
## the queue. For example, PBS by default offers the FIFO scheduller, many sites run the MAUI.
## At the moment FIFO & MAUI is supported. If you have a MAUI scheduller you
## should specify the "MAUI" value since it modifies the way the queue resources
## are calculated.  BY default the "FIFO" sceduller is assumed.
## allowedvalues: FIFO MAUI
## default: FIFO
#scheduling_policy=FIFO

## comment text - A free-form text field for additional comments on the queue in a single
## line, no newline character is allowed!
## default: not set
#comment=This queue is nothing more than a condor pool

## pbs_queue_node - (previously queue_node_string) In PBS you can assign nodes 
## to a queue (or a queue to nodes) by using the "node property" PBS node config method
## and assigning the marked nodes to the queue 
## (setting the resources_default.neednodes = queue_node_string for that queue). 
## This parameter should contain the "node property" string of the queue-assigned nodes. 
## Setting the queue_node_string changes how the queue-totalcpus, user freecpus are 
## determined for this queue.
## Essentially, pbs_queue_node value is used to construct nodes= string in
## PBS script, such as nodes=count:queue_node_string where count is taken from
## the job description (1 if not specified). You shouldn't use this option unless
## you are sure that your PBS configuration makes use of the above configuration.
## Read NorduGrid PBS instructions for more information:
##    http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/pbs-config.html
## default: not set
#pbs_queue_node=gridlong_nodes
#pbs_queue_node=ppn=4:ib
## CHANGE: renamed

## sge_jobopts string - Additional SGE options to be used when submitting jobs to SGE
## from this queue. 
## default: not set
#sge_jobopts=-P atlas -r yes

## condor_requirements string - It needs to be defined for each Condor queue. 
## Use this option to determine which nodes belong to the current queue.  
## The value of 'condor_requirements' must be a valid constraints string
## which is recognized by a condor_status -constraint '....' command. It can
## reference pre-defined ClassAd attributes (like Memory, Opsys, Arch, HasJava,
## etc) but also custom ClassAd attributes.  To define a custom attribute on a
## condor node, just add two lines like the ones below in the `hostname`.local
## config file on the node:
##   NORDUGRID_RESOURCE=TRUE
##   STARTD_EXPRS = NORDUGRID_RESOURCE, $(STARTD_EXPRS)
## A job submitted to this queue is allowed to run on any node which satisfies
## the 'condor_requirements' constraint.  If 'condor_requirements' is not set,
## jobs will be allowed to run on any of the nodes in the pool. When configuring
## multiple queues, you can differentiate them based on memory size or disk
## space, for example.
## TODO: wrongly implemented in the backends: queue-level values are ignored!
## default: not set
#condor_requirements=(OpSys == "linux" && NORDUGRID_RESOURCE && Memory >= 1000 && Memory < 2000)

## totalcpus number - Manually sets the number of cpus assigned to the queue. No need to
## specify the parameter in case the queue_node_string method was used to assign
## nodes to the queue (this case it is dynamically calculated and the static
## value is overwritten) or when the queue have access to the entire cluster
## (this case the cluster level totalcpus is the relevant parameter). 
## default: not set
#totalcpus=32

## queue-level configuration parameters: nodecpu, nodememory, architecture, opsys
## and benchmark should be set if they are homogeneous over the nodes assigned
## to the queue AND they are different from the cluster-level value.
## Their meanings are described in the [cluster] block. Usage: this queue collects
## nodes with "nodememory=512" while another queue has nodes with
## "nodememory=256" -> don't set the cluster attributes but use the queue-level
## attributes. When the frontend's architecture or cputype agrees with the queue
## nodes, the "adotf" (Automatically Determine On The Frontend) can be used to
## request automatic determination of architecture or nodecpu.
## For GLUE2, fine tune configuration of OSName, OSVersion, OSFamily
## is allowed in a dedicated subblock.

## nodecpu formatted_string - see description at [cluster] block
## default: not set
#nodecpu=AMD Duron(tm) Processor @ 700 MHz

## nodememory number - see description at [cluster] block

## benchmark name value - see description at [cluster] block
## multivalued
## default: not set
#benchmark=SPECINT2000 222
#benchmark=SPECFP2000 333

## ac_policy rule - Defines queue access policy rules based on VOMS attributes in user's
## proxy certificate (requires the arc-vomsac-check plugin to be enabled).
## This is a TEMPORARY solution for enforcing queue-based access control with authplugins
## Matching rules have the following format:
##   ac_policy=[+/-]VOMS: <FQAN>
## Please read arc-vomsac-check manual page for more information.
## multivalued
## default: not set
#ac_policy=-VOMS: /badvo
#ac_policy=VOMS: /.*/Role=production

## authorizedvo voname - This attribute is used to advertise which VOs are authorized
## on each specific queue. Multiple entries are allowed.
## Add only one VO for each authorizedvo entry. Multiple VOs in the same line
## will cause errors.
## These entries will be shown in the MappingPolicy objects, that is, 
## they will apply for the Shares that corresponds to the queue.
## NOTE: if you have also configured authorizedvo in the [cluster] block,
## the result authorized VOs per queue is the union set of what is 
## contained in the [cluster] and in this [queue] block.
## IMPORTANT: This parameter is NOT enforcing any access control, it is just for 
## information publishing!
## multivalued
## default: not set
#authorizedvo=LocalUsers
#authorizedvo=atlas
#authorizedvo=community.nordugrid.org

## maxslotsperjob number - This GLUE2 specific parameter configures the MaxSlotsPerJob value
## on a particular queue. This value is usually generated by LRMS infocollectors, 
## but there are cases in which a system administrator might like to tweak it.
## Default is to publish what is returned by the LRMS, and if nothing is
## returned, NOT to publish the MaxSlotsPerJob attribute.
## If a system administrator sets the value here, that value will be
## published instead, regardless of what the LRMS returns.
## Each LRMS might have a different meaning for this value.
## default: not set
#maxslotsperjob=5

## cachetime - LDAP parameters of the queue+jobs+users.pl (old) infoprovider, use the defaults,
## CHANGED: DELETED.

## sizelimit - affects registration to EGIIS
