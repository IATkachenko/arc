.SH NAME
arc.conf, .arc/client.conf \- ARC configuration

.SH DESCRIPTION
Configuration files for NorduGrid ARC.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/arc.conf

.B ${ARC_LOCATION}/etc/arc.conf

.B ${HOME}/.arc/client.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION

The ARC configuration file consists of several configuration blocks.
Each configuration block is identified by a keyword and contains the
configuration options for a specific part of the ARC middleware.

The ARC configuration file can be written in one of two different
formats: plain text or xml. In the plain text format each
configuration block starts with its identifying keyword inside
square brackets. Thereafter follows one or more attribute value pairs
written one on each line in the following format
(note that the attribute names are CASE-SENSITIVE):

.nf
.B [keyword1]
.BR attribute1 ="value1"
.BR attribute2 ="value2"

.B [keyword2]
.BR attribute ="value"
.fi

In the xml format the arc configuration file consist of a single "arc"
xml element. Inside this element each configuration block appears as a
separate xml element named after the block's identifying keyword. This
block in turn contains attribute value pairs in the following format:

.nf
.B <arc>
.RB \  <keyword1>
.RB \ \  <attribute1> value1 </attribute1>
.RB \ \  <attribute2> value2 </attribute2>
.RB \  </keyword1>
.RB \  <keyword2>
.RB \ \  <attribute> value </attribute>
.RB \  </keyword2>
.B </arc>
.fi

However, if a configuration block has an id attribute, it should be
given as an xml attribute to the keyword instead:

.BR <keyword\ id ="value" >

Some options can also have suboptions. In the plain text format these
are given as a comma separated list without spaces of attribute value
pairs before the option value:

.BR attribute =" subattr1 =subval1, subattr2 =subval2\ value"

In the xml format the suboptions are given as attributes to the xml
tag:

.BR <attribute\ subattr1 ="subval1"\  subattr2 ="subval2" > value </attribute>

The following keywords are used in the block names: common, client,
group, data-staging, nordugridmap, vo, grid-manager, gridftpd, infosys, 
registration, cluster, queue.

If the ARC_LOCATION environment variable is set the ARC configuration
file located at ${ARC_LOCATION}/etc/arc.conf is read first. If this
file is not present or the relevant configuration information is not
found in this file, the file at /etc/arc.conf is read.

For ARC client applications each user can specify a personal
configuration file at ${HOME}/.arc/client.conf. Only the common and
client blocks are used in this file. If this file is not present or
does not contain the relevant configuration information the global
configuration files are read instead.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS

Options listed in the common configuration block affect all parts of
the ARC middleware, unless overridden in a configuration block for a
particular service or a command line option.

.SH CLIENT OPTIONS

.TP
.B giis
Configures which GIISes to use to discover computing and storage
resources. The default is to use the four top level GIISes:

ldap://index1.nordugrid.org:2135/O=Grid/Mds-Vo-name=NorduGrid
.br
ldap://index2.nordugrid.org:2135/O=Grid/Mds-Vo-name=NorduGrid
.br
ldap://index3.nordugrid.org:2135/O=Grid/Mds-Vo-name=NorduGrid
.br
ldap://index4.nordugrid.org:2135/O=Grid/Mds-Vo-name=NorduGrid

This option can be repeated several times.

.I Example
(plain text):

giis="ldap://atlasgiis.nbi.dk:2135/O=Grid/Mds-Vo-name=Atlas"

.I Example
(xml):

<giis>ldap://odin.switch.ch:2135/O=Grid/Mds-Vo-name=Switzerland</giis>

.TP
.B debug

Default debug level to use for the arc clients. Corresponds to the -d
command line switch of the clients. Default value is 0.

.I Example
(plain text): debug="2"

.I Example
(xml): <debug>2</debug>

.TP
.B timeout
Timeout to use for interaction with LDAP servers, gridftp servers,
etc. If a server, during e.g. job submission, does not answer in the
specified number of seconds, the connection is timed out and
closed. Default value is 20 seconds.

.I Example
(plain text): timeout="20"

.I Example
(xml): <timeout>10</timeout>

.TP
.B downloaddir
Default download directory to download files to when retrieving output
files from jobs using arccli get. Default is the current working
directory.

.I Example
(plain text): downloaddir="/home/johndoe/arc-downloads"

.I Example
(xml): <downloaddir>/tmp/johndoe</downloaddir>

.TP
.B alias
Alias substitutions to perform in connection with the -c command line
switch of the arc clients. Alias definitions are recursive. Any alias
defined in a block that is read before a given block can be used in
alias definitions in that block. An alias defined in a block can also
be used in alias definitions later in the same block. This option can
be repeated several times.

.I Example
(plain text):

alias="host1=somehost.nbi.dk"
.br
alias="host2=otherhost.uu.se"
.br
alias="myhosts=host1 host2"

.I Example
(xml):

<alias>host1=somehost.nbi.dk</alias>
.br
<alias>host2=otherhost.uu.se</alias>
.br
<alias>myhosts=host1 host2</alias>

With the example above "arcsub -c myhosts" will resolve to "arcsub -c
somehost.nbi.dk -c otherhost.uu.se"

.TP
.B broker
Configures which broker to use during job submission. The default one
is the FastestCpus broker that chooses, among the possible targets,
the target with the fastest CPUs. Another possibility is the
RandomSort broker that chooses the target randomly among the targets
surviving the job description matchmaking.

.I Example
(plain text): broker="RandomSort"

.I Example
(xml): <broker>RandomSort</broker>

.PP

.SH GROUP OPTIONS

The group configuration blocks define rules used to determine to which
authorisation groups a user belongs. Each authorisation group is
defined in its own group configuration block and should be given a
unique id. If the plain text format is used, the authorisation group
"users" is defined by:

.nf
.B [group]
.BR id ="users"
.fi

If the xml format is used the same block is defined using the
attributed xml tag:

.BR <group\ id ="users" > ... </group>

The attribute value pairs in a group configuration block represent
rules for allowing or denying users as members of the group. These
rules are processed in order of appearance. The first rule that
matches the information presented by a user stops the processing of
the remaining rules in the block. The result of a rule can be
inverted, so that a matching rule counts as non-matching and vice
versa. In the plain text format this is done by prepending the rule
with an exclamation mark. In the xml format it is done by adding a
match attribute with the value "inverted" to the rule's xml tag.

A matching rule can either allow or deny a user. If the plain text
format is used an allow rule is defined by prepending a the rule with
plus sign and a deny rule by prepending it with a minus sign. If the
xml format is used the type of rule is indicated by adding a rule
attribute with a value of "allow" or "deny" to the xml tag. In either
format, if the type is not indicated, the rule is interpreted as an
allow rule. Currently the authorisation groups can be referred to in
gridftpd and httpsd blocks.

.TP
.B subject
Match a specific certificate subject.

.I Examples
(plain text):

+subject="/O=Grid/O=Big VO/CN=Main Boss"
.br
-subject="/O=Grid/O=Tiny VO/CN=Small Boss"
.br
!subject="/O=Grid/O=Bad VO/CN=Evil Boss"

.I Examples
(xml):

<subject rule="allow">/O=Grid/O=Big VO/CN=Main Boss</subject>
.br
<subject rule="reject">/O=Grid/O=Tiny VO/CN=Small Boss</subject>
.br
<subject match="inverted">/O=Grid/O=Bad VO/CN=Evil Boss</subject>

These examples will allow the Big Boss, deny the Small Boss and
allow everyone except the Evil Boss (except the Small Boss which was
denied by the previous rule).

.TP
.B all
Matches any credential.

.I Example
(plain text): all="all"

.I Example
(xml): <all>all</all>

.TP
.B file
This is convenient for directly adding gridmap like lists to
authorisation groups.

.IR Example :
file="/etc/grid-security/local-users"

.TP
.B group
Match users belonging to a different group. The value for this
attribute is the id of the referred group.

.IR Example :
group="admins"

.TP
.B plugin
Run an external executable or a function from shared library. The rule
matches if the plugin returns 0. The value for this attribute is a
space separated list of arguments in the format "[function@]path [arg1
[arg2 [...]]]". If the plugin is given as function@path then the
function

.RB int\  function \ (char*\  arg1 ,\ char*\  arg2 ,\ ...)

from the shared library at path is called. Otherwise the external
executable at the specified path is called with the given arguments.

In the arguments the following substitutions are supported:

.RS
.TP
.B %D
the subject of the user's certificate

.TP
.B %P
the path to the proxy file

.PP
Optionally a timeout value (specified in seconds) can be given by
adding a suboption.

.I Example
(plain text):

plugin="timeout=10 /opt/external/bin/permis %P"

.I Example
(xml):

<plugin timeout="10">/opt/external/bin/permis %P</plugin>
.RE

.TP
.B remote
Check the user's credentials against a remote service. Only URLs to
groups stored at LDAP directories are supported.

.IR Example :

remote="ldap://grid-vo.nordugrid.org/ou=people,dc=nordugrid,dc=org"

.TP
.B vo
Match users belonging to a VO (virtual organisation) as configured in
one of vo blocks. The value for this attribute is the id of the
referred VO.

.IR Example :
vo="nordugrid"

.TP
.B voms
Match a voms (virtual organisation management service) credential. The
value for this attribute should be a space separated list of voms
attributes to be matched in the order "vo group role capability". A
`*' can be used as a wildcard for any value.

.IR Example :
voms="nordugrid guests * *"

.SH VO OPTIONS

A vo block is used to define VOs (virtual organisations) and generate
mapfiles from user lists maintained by VO databases. A vo block is a
configuration block for the nordugridmap utility. 
.PP
NOTE: Currently 
.BR nordugridmap (1)
utility works only with plain text configuration format.
.PP
The vo blocks can also be used and referenced in authorisation group 
blocks and in gacl expressions. Each vo block MUST be given an unique
name. If the plain text format is used, the vo group "atlas" is defined by:

.nf
.B [vo]
.BR vo ="atlas"
.fi

If the xml format is used the same block is defined using the
attributed xml tag:

.BR <vo\ vo ="atlas" > ... </vo>

.TP
.B file
The file which contains the user lists associated with this VO. The
file is automatically generated using the nordugridmap utility.
If the same file specified as output for different [vo] blocks, 
nordugridmap will automatically merge enrties in given blocks order.
Default is "/etc/grid-security/gridmapfile".

.IR Example :
file="/etc/grid-security/VOs/atlas-users"

.TP
.B source
The URL of a VO database assigned to this VO. The nordugridmap utility
will use this URL to automatically generate and keep up-to-date the
user list (mapfile) specified by the \fBfile\fP attribute. This is a
multivalued attribute \- several sources can be specified for a vo
block and all the users from those sources will be merged into the
same file. The source URLs are processed in the given order. 
.PP
.RS
Currently supported URL types are:
.TP 
.B http(s)://
URL to plain text file. File should contain a list of DNs with 
optional issuer certificate authority DN (see \fBrequire_issuerdn\fP): 
"user DN" ["issuer DN"]
.TP 
.B voms(s)://
URL to VOMS-Admin interface
.TP 
.B nordugrid
Add NorduGrid VO members
.TP 
.B ldap://
Point to LDAP-schema formatted VO Group
.B file://
Local file (stand-alone or dynamicaly generated by nordugridmap). 
File should contain a list of DNs with optional mapped unixid: 
"user DN" [mapped unixID]. Result of optional mapped unixid processing 
depend on \fBmapuser_processing\fP nordugridmap configuration block 
settings.
.TP 
.B vo://
Reference to another vo configuration block
.PP

.RE

.TP
.B mapped_unixid
The local UNIXID which is used in the generated grid-mapfile by the 
nordugridmap utility.
If any of the sources have already provided mapping information (file:// 
or vo://) behavior depends on \fBmapuser_processing\fP nordugridmap block
conguration value:
.RS
.TP 
.BR mapuser_processing ="overwrite"
ignore already provided mapping and apply mapped_unixid for all sources
.TP 
.BR mapuser_processing ="keep"
apply mapped_unixid only for sources that does not already has mapping 
information
.PP
vo block can only have one UNIXID. If \fBmapped_unixid\fP is not specified 
behavior depends on \fBallow_empty_unixid\fP nordugridmap block conguration
value:
.TP 
.BR allow_empty_unixid ="yes"
empty value will be used for \fBmapped_unixid\fP which means that 
nordugridmap will generate only the list of DNs without mapping (consider 
using \fBmapuser_processing\fP="overwrite" along with this option or
sources that does not provide previously defined mapping information)
.TP
.BR allow_empty_unixid ="no"
skip users without mapping information (if no mapping information provided 
by sources)
.PP
.IR Example :
mapped_unixid="gridtest"
.RE

.TP
.B require_issuerdn
If set to "yes" only those DNs obtained from the URLs which have the
corresponding public CA packages installed will be mapped. Default is
"no".
.PP
.RS
Note, that some sources does not provide issuer information (like 
voms(s):// or file://). If this sources are used within vo block
and \fBrequire_issuerdn\fP is set to "yes" behavior depends on 
\fBissuer_processing\fP nordugridmap block conguration value:
.TP
.BR issuer_processing ="relaxed"
check only those records that have issuer information provided, allow 
other sources
.TP 
.BR issuer_processing ="strict"
if issuer information was not found record is filtered and will not be 
passed into mapfile
.PP
.IR Example :
require_issuerdn="no"
.RE

.TP
.B filter
An ACL filter for the nordugridmap utility. Multiple allow/deny
statements are possible. The fetched DNs are filtered against the
specified rules before they are added to the generated mapfile. 
.PP
.RS
A `*' can be used as a wildcard. You may run the nordugridmap with the
--test command line option to see how the filters you specified work.
.PP
If at least one allow filter is specified implicit deny is used at the 
end of ACL. If only deny filters are present - implicit allow used.

.IR Examples :

filter="deny *infn*"
.br
filter="allow *NorduGrid*"

.SH GRID-MANAGER OPTIONS

The grid-manager block configures the grid-manager process taking care
of the grid tasks on the frontend (stagein/stageout, LRMS job
submission, caching, etc...).

.TP
.B controldir
The directory of the grid-manager's internal job log files, not needed
on the nodes.

.IR Example :
controldir="/var/spool/nordugrid/jobstatus"

.TP
.B sessiondir
The directory which holds the session directories of the grid jobs.
Multiple session directories may be specified by specifying multiple sessiondir
commands. In this case jobs are spread evenly over the session directories.
If sessiondir="*" is set, the session directory will be spread over the
${HOME}/.jobs directories of every locally mapped unix user. It is
preferred to use common session directories.

.IR Example :
sessiondir="/scratch/grid"

.TP
.B runtimedir
The directory which holds the runtime environment scripts, should be
available on the nodes as well. The runtime environments are
automatically detected and advertised in the information system.

.IR Example :
runtimedir="/SOFTWARE/runtime"

.TP
.B cachedir
Specifies the directory where to store cached data. If the cache
attribute is not specified or the specified path is empty caching is
disabled. An optional second argument specifies the path at which the
cached data is accessible at the computing nodes (if different from
the path at the frontend node). If the second argument is set to `.'
files are not soft-linked, but copied to the session
directory. Multiple caches can be specified by specifying multiple
cachedir options

.IR Examples :

cachedir="/scratch/cache"
.br
cachedir="/shared/cache /frontend/cache"

.TP
.B remotecachedir 
Specifies caches which are under the control of
other GMs, but which this GM can have read-only access to.  Multiple
remote cache directories may be specified by specifying multiple
remotecachedir commands. If a file is not available in paths specified
by cachedir, the GM looks in remote caches. The second argument has the same
meaning as in cachedir, but the special path ``replicate'' means files
will be replicated from remote caches to local caches when they are
requested.

.IR Example:
remotecachedir="/mnt/fs1/cache replicate"

.TP
.B cachesize 
Value should be given as "max min". Specifies high
and low watermark for space used by cache. Values are specified as
percentages of the cache file system.

.IR Example :
cachesize="80 70"

.TP
.B cachelifetime
If cache cleaning is enabled, files accessed less recently than the given
time period will be deleted. Example values of this option are 1800, 90s, 24h,
30d. When no suffix is given the unit is seconds.

.IR Example :
cachelifetime="30d"

.TP
.B cachelogfile
Specifies the filename where output of the cache-clean tool should be
logged. Defaults to /var/log/arc/cache-clean.log.

.IR Example :
cachelogfile="/tmp/cache-clean.log"

.TP
.B cacheloglevel
Specifies the level of logging by the cache-clean tool, between 0 (FATAL)
and 5 (DEBUG). Defaults to 3 (INFO).

.IR Example :
cacheloglevel="2"

.TP
.B cachecleantimeout
The timeout in seconds for running the cache-clean tool. If using a large
cache or slow file system this value can be increased to allow the cleaning
to complete. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

.IR Example:
cachecleantimeout="10000"

.TP
.B user

argument is user[:group]. 

.IR Examples :

user="grid"
.br
user="griduser:gridgroup"

.TP
.B debug
Set the debug level of the grid-manager daemon between 0 (FATAL) and 5 (DEBUG).
Defaults to 3 (INFO).

.IR Example :
debug="2"

.TP
.B logfile
Specify the log file location. This file is opened/created before the
daemon switches to specified user. Hence it can be owned by
root. Default log file is "/var/log/arc/grid-manager.log".

.IR Example :
logfile="/var/log/arc/grid-manager.log"

.TP
.B logsize
Specifies the (approximate) maximum size in bytes of the log file. A
second argument indicates how many log files are kept. When the logfile
exceeds the specified size it is renamed to logfile.0 and logfile.0 is
renamed to logfile.1 and so on. When installing from packages, logrotate
is used to manage log files, so only use this option if logrotate is
disabled. 

.IR Example :
logsize="100000 2"

.TP
.B pidfile
Specifies the location of the file containing the process id (PID) of
the daemon process. This is useful for automatic start/stop scripts.

.IR Example :
pidfile="/var/run/grid-manager.pid"

.TP
.B gnu_time
the GNU time command. Default is /usr/bin/time.

.IR Example :
gnu_time="/usr/bin/time"

.TP
.B shared_filesystem
Specifies whether the computing nodes can access the session directory
at the frontend node. Defaults to "yes".

.IR Example :
shared_filesystem="yes"

.TP
.B mail
Specifies the e-mail address from where the notification mails are sent.

.IR Example :
mail="grid.support@somewhere.org"

.TP
.B joblog
Specifies where to store a specialised log about started and finished
jobs. If the given path is empty or the joblog attribute is not given
the log is disabled.

.IR Example :
joblog="/var/log/arc/gm-jobs.log"

.TP
.B jobreport
Tells the grid-manager to report all started and finished jobs to a
logger service. Multiple jobreport commands are allowed. In that case
the job information will be sent to all specified services.

.IR Example :
jobreport="https://grid.uio.no:8001/logger"

.TP
.B jobreport_publisher
Name of the accounting records publisher.

.IR Example :
jobreport_publisher="jura"

.TP
.B jobreport_credentials

.TP
.B jobreport_options
Specifies additional parameters for the jobreporter.

.IR Example  
jobreport_options="urbatch:50,archiving:/tmp/archive"

.TP
.B maxjobs
Specifies the maximum allowed number of jobs being processed at 
different stages: 1. max processed jobs - maximum number of concurrent
jobs processed. This does not limit the amount of jobs which can be 
submitted to the cluster. 2. max running jobs - maximum number of 
jobs passed to Local Resource Management System. 3. max jobs per dn -
maximum number of concurrent jobs processed by A-REX per user DN. If this
option is used the total maximum number of jobs processed is still 
max processed jobs. 4. max jobs total - total maximum number of jobs
associated with service. It is advised to use this limit only in
exceptional case because it also accounts for finished jobs. Missing 
number or -1 means no limit.

.IR Example :
maxjobs="10000 10 1000"

.TP
.B maxload
Specifies the maximum allowed number of jobs. The value should be
three numbers separated by spaces. The first number limits the number
of jobs being processed on frontend (PREPARING, FINISHING states). The
second number is the additional reserved number of jobs being
processed on frontend. The third number limits the number of files
being transferred simultaneously by jobs in PREPARING and FINISHING
states. Missing number or -1 means no limit. With newdatastaging="yes"
options in [data-staging] should be used instead.

.IR Example :
maxload="10 2 5"

.TP
.B maxloadshare
Specifies a sharing mechanism for data transfer. The values are an integer
followed by a space followed by a string. The first number is the maximum
number of processes that can run per transfer share and the string is the scheme
used to assign jobs to transfer shares. Possible values of this string
are "dn", "voms:vo", "voms:role", and "voms:group". With newdatastaging="yes"
options in [data-staging] should be used instead.

.IR Example:
maxloadshare="4 voms:role"

.TP
.B share_limit
Specifies a transfer share that has a number of processes different from the
default value in maxloadshare. name is the name of the share and limit is
the number of processes for this share. In the configuration should appear
after maxloadshare. Can be repeated several times for different shares. With
newdatastaging="yes" options in [data-staging] should be used instead.

.IR Example:
share_limit="atlas:production 10"

.TP
.B newdatastaging
Turns on and off the new data staging framework which replaces the downloader
and uploader for managing input and output files. Options for this are set in
the [data-staging] section. It is off by default.

.IR Example:
newdatastaging="yes"

.TP
.B wakeupperiod
Specifies how often the grid-manager checks for new jobs arrived, jobs
finished in LRMS, etc. The value should be an integer representing a
time period in seconds. Default is 3 minutes. Usually this command is
not needed.

.IR Example :
wakeupperiod="180"

.TP
.B securetransfer
Specifies if the server allows users to specify to use secure data
transfer. Default is "no".

.IR Example :
securetransfer="no"

.TP
.B passivetransfer
Specifies whether gridftp transfers are passive. Setting this option
to yes can solve transfer problems caused by firewalls. Default is "no".

.IR Example :
passivetransfer="no"

.TP
.B localtransfer
If set to "yes" the data download to the session directory (stage in)
will be part of the batch job (prior to the execution of the binary).
Default is "no".

.IR Example :
localtransfer="no"

.TP
.B speedcontrol
Specifies how slow data transfers must be to trigger an error. The
value should be four integers separated by spaces in the format
"min_speed min_time min_average_speed max_inactivity". The transfer is
cancelled if the speed is below min_speed bytes per second for at
least min_time seconds, or if average rate is below min_average_speed
bytes per second, or no data was transferred for longer than
max_inactivity seconds. A value of zero turns feature off. Default is
"0 300 0 300".

.IR Example :
speedcontrol="0 300 0 300"

.TP
.B defaultttl
The value should be given as "ttl [ttr]". ttl is the time in seconds
for how long a session directory will survive after job execution has
finished. If not specified the default is one week. ttr is how long
information about a job will be kept. If not specified the ttr
default is one month.

.IR Example :
defaultttl="259200"  

.TP
.B authplugin
Every time a job goes into a specific state the specified executable
is run with the given arguments. In the plain text format the state is
specified by adding its name before the path to the executable and any
specified suboptions. In the xml format the state is given by a state
xml attribute to the xml tag. Possible suboptions are:

.RS
.TP
.B timeout
wait for result no longer than the specified number of seconds.

.TP
.B onsuccess, onfailure, ontimeout
what to do if the plugin exits with exit code zero, with non-zero exit
code or if the timeout is reached respectively. Possible values are:

.I pass
\- continue the execution of the job,

.I fail
\- cancel the job,

.I log
\- write to the log file about the problem and continue the execution of
the job.

.PP
.I Example
(plain text):

authplugin="ACCEPTED timeout=10 /opt/nordugrid/libexec/bank %C/job.%I.local %S"

.I Example
(xml):

<authplugin state="ACCEPTED" timeout="10">/opt/nordugrid/libexec/bank %C/job.%I.local %S</authplugin>

ARC is distributed with a plugin called "inputcheck". It's purpose is
to check if input files requested in job's XRSL are accessible from
this machine. It accepts two arguments: the name of the file
containing the XRSL and name of the proxy file.

.I Example
(plain text):

authplugin="ACCEPTED timeout=60 /opt/nordugrid/libexec/inputcheck %C/job.%I.description %C/job.%I.proxy"

(xml):

<authplugin state="ACCEPTED" timeout="60">/opt/nordugrid/libexec/inputcheck %C/job.%I.description %C/job.%I.proxy</authplugin>
.RE

.TP
.B localcred
Run an external executable or a function form a shared library. Every
time the job has to do something on behalf of a local user this plugin
will be called. It's purpose is to set non-unix permissions and
credentials on the running task. If the plugin path looks like
name@path, then the function "name" from the shared library at path
will be called, otherwise the external executable at path will be

obtained path will be copied to the session directory. NOTE:
`local_path' can also be of URL type. You can have several copyurl
lines.

soft-link will be created. The `local_path' specifies the way to
access the file from the gatekeeper, and is used to check
permissions. The `node_path' specifies how the file can be accessed
from computing nodes, and will be used for soft-link creation. If
`node_path' is missing \- `local_path' will be used. You can have
multiple linkurl settings.

.IR Example :

Sets the debug level/verbosity of the startup script {0 or 1}.
Default is 0.

.IR Example :
debug="1"

.TP
.B slapd_loglevel
Sets the native slapd log level (see man slapd). Slapd logs via
syslog. The default is set to no-logging (0) and it is RECOMMENDED not
to be changed in a production environment. Non-zero slap_loglevel
value causes serious performance decrease.

.IR Example :
slapd_loglevel="0"

.TP
.B slapd_hostnamebind
May be used to set the hostname part of the
network interface to which the slapd process will bind. Most of
the cases no need to set since the hostname config parameter is already
sufficient. The default is empty. The example below will bind the slapd
process to all the network interfaces available on the server.

.IR Example :
slapd_hostnamebind="*"


.TP
.B threads
The native slapd threads parameter, default is 32. If you run an Index
service too you should modify this value.

.IR Example :
threads="128"

.TP
.B timelimit
The native slapd timelimit parameter. Maximum number of seconds the
slapd server will spend answering a search request. Default is 3600.
You probably want a much lower value.

.IR Example :
timelimit="1800"

.TP
.B idletimeout
The native slapd idletimeout parameter. Maximum number of seconds the slapd
server will wait before forcibly closing idle client connections. It's value
must be larger than the value of "timelimit" option. If not set, it defaults to
timelimit + 1.
.IR Example :
idletimeout="1800"

.TP
.B registrationlog
Specifies the log file for the registration processes initiated by your
machine. Default is "/var/log/arc/inforegistration.log".

.IR Examples :

limit_core="0"
.br
limit_nofile=""

.TP
.B user
The unix user running the information system processes such as the
slapd, the registrations and information provider scripts. By default the
user executing the startup script is set. In case of non-root value
you must make sure that the grid-manager directories and their content
are readable by the `user' and the `user' has access to the full LRMS
information including jobs submitted by other users. The grid-manager
directories (controldir, sessiondir, runtimedir, cachedir) are
specified in the grid-manager block

.IR Example :
user="root"

.TP
.B giis_location
If giis_location is not set, NORDUGRID_LOCATION will be used instead.

.IR Example :
giis_location="/opt/nordugrid"


.TP .B BDII related variables and their default values Nordugrid ARC
works together with both BDII4 and BDII5.  If you use the
nordugrid-packaged BDII installation, these variables have sensible
defaults and can be omitted. The only variables that system
administrators may want to change when using nordugrid-bdii are
infosys_nordugrid and infosys_glue12.  These two variables specify
what format the output should be in, default is
infosys_nordugrid=enable, infosys_glue12=disable. If infosys_glue12 is
enabled, then you need to set resource_location, resource_latitude,
resource_longitude, cpuscalingreferencesi00,
processorotherdescription, gluesiteweb and gluesiteuniqueid under the
[infosys/glue12] block. These variables do not have default
values. You may also want to set provide_glue_site_info to false in
case you want to set up a more complicated setup with several
publishers of data to a GlueSite.  The rest of the variables defaults
are showcased here. infosys_debug disables/enables an ldap-database at
the ldap tree entrypoint o=infosys. Note, the gLite supplied BDII
installs into /opt/bdii. If you for some reason do not want to use the
bdb ldap backend, you can set this with bdii_database.

.IR Examples :

General BDII options.

.SH GRID INFORMATION INDEX SERVICE (GIIS) OPTIONS

The Index Service block configures and enables an Information Index
Service. A separate configuration block is required for every Index
Service you may run on a given machine. Each index service should be
given its own id. This id is used as the index name in the
"Mds-Vo-name=indexname, O=Grid" LDAP suffix characterising the Index
Service. If the plain text format is used, the index service
identified as "indexname" is defined by:

.nf
.B [infosys/site]
.BR id="sitename"
.fi

Site BDII configuration block, this block is used to configure ARC to
generate a site-bdii that can be registered in GOCDB etc to make it a
part of a gLite network. The sitename part is to be declarative of the
site-bdii being generated.

.IR Examples :
The unique id used to identify this site, eg "NDGF-T1"
.br
unique_id=""
.br
The url is on the format:
ldap://host.domain:2170/mds-vo-name=something,o=grid and should point
to the resource-bdii.
.br
url=""
.br

.nf
.B [infosys/index]
.BR id ="indexname"
.fi

If the xml format is used the same block is defined using the
attributed xml tag inside the infosys block:

.nf
.B <infosys>
.RB \  <index\ id ="indexname" > ... </index>
.B </infosys>
.fi

.TP
.B allowreg
Implements registration filtering within an Index Sevice. Sets the
Local Information Trees or lower level Index Services allowed to
register to the Index Service. List each allowed registrant with the
allowreg attribute. Specifying allowreg implies setting up a strict
filtering, only the matching registrants will be able to register to
the Index. The wildcard `*' can be used in allowreg. Several allowreg
lines can be used.

.IR Examples :

All the Swedish machines can register regardless they are resources or
indexes:

allowreg="*.se:2135"

Cluster resources from Denmark can register:

allowreg="*.dk:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=*, Mds-Vo-name=local, O=Grid"

Storage resources from HIP, Finland can register:

allowreg="*.hip.fi:2135/nordugrid-se-name=*, Mds-Vo-name=local, O=Grid"

The index1.sweden.se can register as a Sweden Index (and only as a
Sweden Index):

allowreg="index1.sweden.se:2135/Mds-Vo-name=Sweden, O=Grid"

Any Index Service can register:

allowreg="*:2135/Mds-Vo-name=*, O=Grid"

.SH GRID INFORMATION INDEX SERVICE REGISTRATION OPTIONS

Options for registering a grid information index service (GIIS) to a
higher level in the Information System. Each GIIS can be registered to
more than one information index server. Each registration is
configured in its own configuration block.

If the plain text format is used, the registration of the index
service identified as "indexname" is defined by:

.nf
.B [infosys/index/registration]
.BR id ="indexname"
.fi

If the xml format is used the same block is defined using a
registration tag inside the attributed xml tag inside the infosys
block:

.nf
.B <infosys>
.RB \  <index\ id ="indexname" >
.RB \ \  <registration> ... </registration>
.RB \  </index>
.B </infosys>
.fi

.TP
.B targethostname
The hostname of the machine running the registration target Index
Service

.IR Example :
targethostname="index.myinstitute.org"

.TP
.B targetport
The port on which the target Index Service is running. The default is
the 2135 Grid Resource Information Service port.

.IR Example :
targetport="2135"

.TP
.B targetsuffix
The LDAP suffix of the target Index Service

.IR Example :
targetsuffix="Mds-Vo-name=BigIndex, O=Grid"

.TP
.B regperiod
The registration period in seconds, the registration messages are
continuously sent according to the regperiod. Default is 120 s.

.IR Example :
regperiod="300"

.TP
.B registranthostname
The hostname of the machine sending the registrations.
This attribute inherits its value from the common and infosys blocks,
most cases no need to set.

.IR Example :
registranthostname="myhost.org"

.TP
.B registrantport
The port of the slapd service hosting the registrant Index
Service. The attribute inherits its value from the [infosys] block
(and therefore defaults to 2135)

.IR Example :
registrantport="2135"

.TP
.B registrantsuffix
The LDAP suffix of the registrant Index Service.
It is automatically determined from the registration block name,
therefore most of the cases no need to specify.

.IR Example :
registrantsuffix="Mds-Vo-name=indexname, O=Grid"

.SH CLUSTER OPTIONS

The cluster block configures how your cluster is seen on the grid
monitor (infosys point of view). Please consult the Infosys manual for
detailed information on cluster attributes.  If you want your cluster
configured below to appear in the infosys (on the monitor) you also
need to create a cluster registration block see the next block.

.TP
.B hostname
The FQDN of the frontend node.

.IR Example :
hostname="myhost.org"

.TP
.B interactive_contactstring
The contact string for interactive logins, set this if the cluster
supports some sort of grid enabled interactive login (gsi-ssh).

.IR Example :
interactive_contactstring="gsissh://frontend.cluster:2200/"

.TP
.B alias
An arbitrary alias name of the cluster, optional.

.IR Example :
alias="Big Blue Cluster in Nowhere"

.TP
.B comment
A free text field for additional comments about the cluster.

.IR Example :

comment="This cluster is specially designed for XYZ applications: www.xyz.org"

.TP
.B cluster_location
The geographical location of the cluster, preferably specified as a
postal code with a two letter country prefix.

.IR Example :
cluster_location="DK-2100"

.TP
.B cluster_owner
It can be used to indicate the owner of a resource, multiple entries
can be used.

.IR Example :
cluster_owner="World Grid Project"

.TP
.B authorizedvo
This attribute is used to advertise which VOs are authorized 
on the cluster. Multiple entries are allowed.

.IR Example :
authorizedvo="developer.nordugrid.org"

.TP
.B clustersupport
This is the support email address of the resource, multiple entries
can be used.

.IR Example :
clustersupport="grid.support@myproject.org"

.TP
.B lrmsconfig
An optional free text field to describe the configuration of your
Local Resource Management System (batch system).

.IR Example :
lrmsconfig="single job per processor"

.TP
.B homogeneity
Determines whether the cluster consists of identical nodes with
respect to CPU type, memory, installed software (opsys). The frontend
does not have to be homogeneous with the nodes. In case of
inhomogeneous nodes, try to arrange the nodes into homogeneous groups
assigned to a queue and use queue level attributes. Possible values:
True, False. The default is True.

.IR Example :
homogeneity="True"

.TP
.B architecture
Sets the hardware architecture of the nodes. The "architecture" is
defined as the output of the "uname -m" (e.g. i686). Use this cluster
attribute if only the nodes are homogeneous with respect to the
architecture.  Otherwise the queue level attribute may be used for
inhomogeneous nodes. If the frontend's architecture agrees to the
nodes, the "adotf" (Automatically Determine On The Frontend) can be
used to request automatic determination.

.IR Example :
architecture="adotf"

.TP
.B opsys
This multivalued attribute is meant to describe the operating system
of the computing nodes. The opsys attribute can also be used to
describe the kernel or libc version in case those differ from the
originally shipped ones. The distribution name should be given as
distroname-version.number, where spaces are not allowed. Kernel
version should come in the form kernelname-version.number. If the
nodes are inhomogeneous with respect to this attribute do not set it
on cluster level, arrange your nodes into homogeneous groups assigned
to a queue and use queue level attributes.

.IR Examples :

opsys="Redhat-7.2"
.br
opsys="Linux-2.4.21-mypatch"
.br
opsys="glibc-2.3.1"

.TP
.B nodecpu
This is the CPU type of the homogeneous nodes. The string is
constructed from the /proc/cpuinfo as the value of "model name" and
"@" and value of "cpu MHz". Do not set this attribute on cluster level
if the nodes are inhomogeneous with respect to CPU type, instead
arrange the nodes into homogeneous groups assigned to a queue and use
queue-level attributes. Setting the nodecpu="adotf" will result in
Automatic Determination On The Frontend, which should only be used if
the frontend has the same CPU type as the homogeneous nodes.

.IR Example :
nodecpu="AMD Duron(tm) Processor @ 700 MHz"

.TP
.B nodememory
This is the amount of memory (specified in MB) on the node which can
be guaranteed to be available for the application. Please note in most
cases it is less than the physical memory installed in the nodes. Do
not set this attribute on cluster level if the nodes are inhomogeneous
with respect to their memories, instead arrange the nodes into
homogeneous groups assigned to a queue and use queue level attributes.

.IR Example :
nodememory="512"

.TP
.B defaultmemory
If a user submits a job without specifying how much memory should be
used, this value will be taken first. The order is: xrsl ->
defaultmemory -> nodememory -> 1GB. This is the amount of memory
(specified in MB) that a job will request(per rank).

.IR Example :
defaultmemory="512"

.TP
.B benchmark
This optional multivalued attribute can be used to specify benchmark
results on the cluster level. Use this cluster attribute if only the
nodes are homogeneous with respect to the benchmark performance.
Otherwise the similar queue level attribute should be used. Please try
to use one of standard benchmark names given below if possible.

.IR Examples :

benchmark="SPECINT2000 222"
benchmark="SPECFP2000 333" 

.TP
.B middleware
The multivalued attribute shows the installed grid software on the
cluster, nordugrid and globus is automatically set, no need to specify
middleware="nordugrid" or middleware="globus".

.IR Example :
middleware="my grid software"

.TP
.B nodeaccess
Determines how the nodes can connect to the internet. Not setting
anything means the nodes are sitting on a private isolated
network. "outbound" access means the nodes can connect to the outside
world while "inbound" access means the nodes can be connected from
outside. inbound & outbound access together means the nodes are
sitting on a fully open network.

.IR Examples :

nodeaccess="inbound"
nodeaccess="outbound"

.TP
.B dedicated_node_string
The string which is used in the PBS node configuration to distinguish the
grid nodes from the rest. Suppose only a subset of nodes are available
for grid jobs, and these nodes have a common "node property" string,
in this case the dedicated_node_string should be set to this value and
only the nodes with the corresponding "pbs node property" are counted
as grid enabled nodes. Setting the dedicated_node_string to the value
of the "pbs node property" of the grid enabled nodes will influence
how the totalcpus and the user freecpus is calculated. You don't need
to set this attribute if your cluster is fully available for the grid
and your cluster's PBS configuration does not use the "node property" method
to assign certain nodes to grid queues. You shouldn't use this configuration
option unless you make sure your PBS configuration makes use of the above
described setup.

.IR Example :
dedicated_node_string="gridnode"

.TP
.B localse
This multivalued parameter tells the broker that certain URLs (and
locations below that) should be considered "locally" available to the
cluster.

.IR Example :
localse="gsiftp://my.storage/data2/"

.TP
.B gm_mount_point
This should be the same as the "path" from the gridftpd's jobplugin
configuration block. The default is "/jobs".

.IR Example :
gm_mount_point="/jobs"

.TP
.B gm_port
This should be the same as the "port" from the gridftpd's jobplugin
block. The default is "2811".

.IR Example :
gm_port="2811"

.TP
.B cachetime, timelimit, sizelimit
LDAP parameters of the cluster information provider. Do not change the
defaults unless you know what you are doing.

.IR Examples :

cachetime="30"
.br
timelimit="30"
.br
sizelimit="10"

.SH CLUSTER REGISTRATION OPTIONS

Options for registering the cluster in the Information System. The
cluster can be registered to more than one information index
server. Each registration is configured in its own configuration block.

If the plain text format is used, the cluster registration block is
defined by:

.B [cluster/registration]

If the xml format is used the same block is defined using a
registration tag inside the cluster block:

.nf
.B <cluster>
.RB \  <registration> ... </registration>
.B </cluster>
.fi

.TP
.B targethostname
See description earlier.

.IR Example :
targethostname="index.myinstitute.org"

.TP
.B targetport
See description earlier.

.IR Example :
targetport="2135"

.TP
.B targetsuffix
See description earlier.

.IR Example :
targetsuffix="Mds-Vo-name=BigIndex, O=Grid"

.TP
.B regperiod
See description earlier.

.IR Example :
regperiod="300"

.TP
.B registranthostname
See description earlier.

.IR Example :
registranthostname="myhost.org"

.TP
.B registrantport
See description earlier.

.IR Example :
registrantport="2135"

.TP
.B registrantsuffix
The LDAP suffix of the registrant cluster resource It is automatically
determined from the infosys block. Don't set it unless you want to
overwrite the default.

.IR Example :
registrantsuffix="nordugrid-cluster-name=myhost.org, Mds-Vo-name=local, O=Grid"

.SH QUEUE OPTIONS

Each grid enabled queue should have a separate queue block. The queue
name should be used as the id of the configuration group. A queue can
represent a PBS queue, an SGE pool, a Condor pool or a machine with a
`fork' LRMS. Queues don't need to be registered (there is no queue
registration block), once you configured your cluster to register to a
Index Service the queue entries (configured with this block)
automatically will be there. Please consult the Infosys manual for
detailed information on queue attributes. The special id `fork' should
be used for identifying the queue block of the fork LRMS.

.TP
.B fork_job_limit
The allowed number of concurrent jobs in a fork system, relevant only
for a fork queue. Default is 1. The special value `cpunumber' can be
used which will set the limit of running jobs to the number of CPUs
available in the machine. This parameter is used in the calculation of
free CPUs in a fork system.

.IR Example :
fork_job_limit="cpunumber"

.TP
.B homogeneity
Determines whether the queue consists of identical nodes with respect
to CPU type, memory, installed software (opsys). In case of
inhomogeneous nodes, try to arrange the nodes into homogeneous groups
and assigned them to a queue. Possible values: True, False. The
default is True.

.IR Example :
homogeneity="True"

.TP
.B scheduling_policy
This optional parameter tells the scheduling policy of the queue. PBS
by default offers the FIFO scheduler, many sites run the MAUI
scheduler. At the moment FIFO & MAUI is supported. If you have a MAUI
scheduler you should specify the "MAUI" value since it modifies the
way the queue resources are calculated. By default the "FIFO"
scheduler is assumed.

.IR Example :
scheduling_policy="FIFO"

.TP
.B comment
A free text field for additional comments about the queue.

.IR Example :
comment="This queue is nothing more than a condor pool"

.TP
.B maui_bin_path
Set this parameter for the path of the maui commands like showbf in
case you specified the "MAUI" scheduling policy above.

.IR Example :
maui_bin_path="/usr/local/bin"

.TP
.B queue_node_string
In PBS you can assign nodes to a queue (or a queue to nodes) by using
the "node property" PBS node configuration method and assigning the marked
nodes to the queue (setting the resources_default.neednodes =
queue_node_string for that queue). This parameter should contain the
"node property" string of the queue assigned nodes. Setting the
queue_node_string changes how the queue's totalcpus and user freecpus
are determined for this queue. You shouldn't use this option unless
you make sure that your PBS configuration makes use of the above
configuration.

.IR Example :
queue_node_string="gridlong_nodes"

.TP
.B sge_jobopts
Specify additional SGE options to be used when submitting jobs to SGE.

.IR Example :
sge_jobopts="-P atlas -r yes"

.TP
.B condor_requirements
Only needed if using Condor. If using mutpiple queues, it needs to be defined
for each queue. Use this option to determine which nodes belong to the current
queue.  The value of 'condor_requirements' must be a valid constraints string
which is recognized by a condor_status -constraint '....' command. It can
reference pre-defined ClassAd attributes (like Memory, Opsys, Arch, HasJava,
etc) but also custom ClassAd attributes.  To define a custom attribute on a
condor node, just add two lines like the ones below in the `hostname`.local
config file on the node:
.nf
   NORDUGRID_RESOURCE=TRUE
   STARTD_EXPRS = NORDUGRID_RESOURCE, $(STARTD_EXPRS)
.fi
.br

A job submitted to this queue is allowed to run on any node which satisfies
the 'condor_requirements' constraint.  If 'condor_requirements' is not set,
jobs will be allowed to run on any of the nodes in the pool. When configuring
multiple queues, you can differentiate them based on memory size or disk space.

.IR Example :
.br

.nf
condor_requirements="(OpSys == "linux" && NORDUGRID_RESOURCE && Memory >= 1000 && Memory < 2000)"
.fi

.TP
.B lsf_architecture
CPU architecture to request when submitting jobs to LSF. Use only if you know
what you are doing.

.IR Example :
lsf_architecture="PowerPC"

.TP
.B totalcpus
Manually sets the number of CPUs assigned to the queue. No need to
specify the parameter in case the queue_node_string method was used to
assign nodes to the queue (this case it is dynamically calculated and
the static value is overwritten) or when the queue have access to the
entire cluster (this case the cluster level totalcpus is the relevant
parameter). Use this static parameter only if some special method is
applied to assign a subset of totalcpus to the queue.

.IR Example :
totalcpus="32"

.TP
.B nodecpu, nodememory, architecture, opsys, benchmark
Queue level configuration parameters should be set if they are
homogeneous over the nodes assigned to the queue and they are
different from the cluster level value. Their meanings are described
in the cluster block. When the frontend's architecture or cputype agrees 
with the queue nodes, the "adotf" (Automatically Determine On The Frontend) 
can be used to request automatic determination of architecture or nodecpu.

.IR Examples:

nodecpu="Pentium III (Coppermine) @ 1001 MHz"
.br
nodememory="512"
.br
architecture="adotf"
.br
opsys="Mandrake 8.0"
.br
opsys="Linux-2.4.19"
.br
benchmark="SPECINT2000 222"
.br
benchmark="SPECFP2000 333"

.TP
.B gridmap
Can be used to specify an alternative file holding the list of
grid SNs for this queue. The information system parses the list of
users from this file and advertises them as authorized users for this queue.
Beware that this list is not actually used by gridftpd for authorization.

.IR Example :
gridmap="/etc/grid-security/queuename-gridmap"

.TP
.B cachetime, timelimit, sizelimit
LDAP parameters of the queue, job and user information provider. Do
not change the defaults unless you know what you are doing.

.IR Examples :

cachetime="30"
.IR
timelimit="30"
.IR
sizelimit="5000"

.SH SERVICES TO ISIS REGISTRATION OPTIONS

Options for registering the services in the ISIS Information System.
This block configures registration of all services into all specified ISISes.

If the plain text format is used, this registration block is
defined by (implemented only for A-REX):

.B [registration/isis]

If the xml format is used the same block is defined using a
InfoRegister tag inside service configuration:

.nf
.B <Service>
.RB \  <InfoRegister xmlns="http://www.nordugrid.org/schemas/infosys/2009/08"> ... </InfoRegister>
.B </Service>
.fi

.TP
