.TH arc-config-check 1 "@DATE@" "NorduGrid ARC @VERSION@" "NorduGrid ARC"
.SH NAME

arc-config-check \- checks the arc.conf for inconsistencies, known problems
or (in a future development) just general bad taste.

.SH SYNOPSIS

arc-config-check --printall

.SH DESCRIPTION

The motivation behind this little script was to have a repository for
automated tests on issues that came up on the NorduGrid developers
mailing list. As such this script indicates directories that are not
present, checks host certificates, CA certificates and CRLs, validates
the sanity of ARC configuration and tests for clock skew.

BECAUSE EVERY INSTALLATION OF ARC IS DIFFERENT THIS UTILITY ONLY SUGGESTS
WHAT COULD BE WRONG. SOMETIMES IT IS OVERRESTRICTIVE. AND SOMETIMES IT
CAN MISS SOME MISCONFIGURATION. NEVER TREAT RESULTS PRODUCED BY IT AS
ULTIMATE TRUTH.
