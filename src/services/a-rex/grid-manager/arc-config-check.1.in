or bad taste.

.SH SYNOPSIS

arc-config-check [--config CONFIG] [--timeserver NTPHOST] [--skip-warnings] [--print-all]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBarc-config-check\fR utility is included into \fBarc-arex\fR
startup process or can be run separately.

It checks \fBarc.conf (5)\fR compies to \fBarc.conf.reference\fR 
syntax, indicates directories that are not present, checks host certificates, 
CA certificates and CRLs, validates the sanity of ARC configuration,
tests for clock skew, etc.

BECAUSE EVERY INSTALLATION OF ARC IS DIFFERENT THIS UTILITY ONLY SUGGESTS
WHAT COULD BE WRONG. SOMETIMES IT IS OVERRESTRICTIVE. AND SOMETIMES IT
CAN MISS SOME MISCONFIGURATION. NEVER TREAT RESULTS PRODUCED BY IT AS
ULTIMATE TRUTH.
