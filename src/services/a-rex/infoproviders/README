Information providers for job/users information.


InfoCollector.pm  - base class for all information collectors (all files *Info.pm)
InfoChecker.pm  - used by InfoCollector to validate options and results against
                  a simple 'schema' (not XML Schema)
GMJobsInfo.pm - collects information about jobs from grid manager status files
HostInfo.pm - collects other information that can be collected on the front end
	      (hostname, software version, disk space for users, installed
              certificates, Runtime environments ...)
LRMSInfo.pm - collects information that is LRMS specific (queues, jobs, local
              user limits ...)
Fork.pm, PBS.pm, SGE.pm, LL.pm, LSF.pm, Condor.pm - plugins for LRMSInfo


The following aim for generating a backwards compatible information schema

ARC0ClusterInfo.pm - collects information about the whole cluster (computing element)
ARC0ClusterSchema.pm - description of the info produced by ARC0ClusterInfo

cluster+qju.pl - driver for information collection. It feeds options read from a
                 config file to ARC0ClusterInfo and prints results in XML


Some modules have a function called 'test' at the end tat can be used to run it
stand alone
