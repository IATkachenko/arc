.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B jura
application is a resource-side accounting (usage logging) client.

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fIctrl_dir\fR [\fIctrl_dir\fR ...]

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "\fB-E\fR"
expiration time (validity length) of job log files in days
.IP "\fB-u\fR"
logging destination URL
.IP "\fB-t\fR"
topic for a destination URL
.IP "\fB-o\fR"
aggregated Apel accounting records directory
.IP "\fB-L\fR"

.LP

.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

Normally, \fBjura\fR is invoked by A-REX periodically with the
appropriate command line arguments, but it can also be executed
interactively.

Job log files, i.e. files produced by A-REX for each job and stored
under \fI<ctrl_dir>/logs\fR contain various usage data and
configuration options for accounting (see NORDUGRID-TECH-24 for
details of their content). These files are parsed by \fBjura\fR,
converted into UR format, and submitted in batches to reporting
destinations. A destination is a resource usage logging service;
currently SGAS LUTS and CAR 1.0 message propagation are supported.
Job log files older than the
expiration time specified with the \fB-E\fR option are deleted without
parsing.

If the \fB-u\fR option is absent, URs are submitted to the destination
URLs specified in the job log files. If submitting succeeds, the
corresponding job log files are deleted. This is the default,
automatic mode of operation.

If destination URLs are specified with the \fB-u\fR option, URs are
submitted only to these destinations (one UR per job to each
destination). In this case, job log files are preserved even if
submitting succeeds.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_CERT

specified in job log files. The default is the standard certificates
directory, \fI/etc/grid-security/certificates\fR.

.TP
.B ARC_LOCATION
The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not
