Remote Policy Decision Point service. It will accept the formated policy 
decision request and return positive/negative response.
Since the request and response information is critical, TLS should be 
switched on for securing communication.

The PDP service can be invoked by two ways: 
1. by client "arcdecision"; 
2. by the pdpinvoker plugin which can be plugged into SecHandler,
   and then SecHandler can be plugged into service (the plugging 
   is based on configuration file). For how to configure pdpinvoker 
   into service, see the configuration file for echo service.
