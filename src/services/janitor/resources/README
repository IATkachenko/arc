Welcome to ARC's Dynamic Runtime Environments
=============================================

This folder contains all the sources that are required to run the
Janitor and the Catalog in conjunction with a local NorduGrid server
installation. Also presented are those files that present the Catalog
to the web. All executables can also be tested independently, i.e., as
for particular interest to those who investigate the integration of the
Janitor and its associated components with a different grid system. For
a start refer to the README.txt files of the subdirectories and in
particular to the handbook at ./doc/documentation.pdf.

To contact us send your concern to the 

  nordugrid-discuss@nordugrid.org

mailing list.
