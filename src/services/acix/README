ARC Cache IndeX - allows publishing of cache contents from several sites to an
index, which can be queried for data-aware brokering. It consists of two
components: a cache server which runs alongside A-REX and gathers cache content
information, and a cache index to which the server publishes the content using
a Bloom filter to reduce the data volume. Several cache servers can publish to
one index.
