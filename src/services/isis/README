This directory contains the Information Indexing Service (ISIS) related to the ARC1 information system.

Since the service uses Berkley XML database for storing the information received from the clients or other ISISs this package is a necessery dependency.There is also a directory needed, where the directory containing the database will be stored.
For example in the sample configuration contains the DBPath attribute as "/storage/arc1/isis1" where "/storage/arc1" have to exists before initializing the service.

The service have to know the own endpoint address that it is available from the clients through. Do not use local addresses at this attribute!

The list of InfoProviderISIS elements contain ISISs that are already connected to the peer-to-peer network with a high probability. If there is no such an ISIS defined than the current one will initialize a new ISIS network. If there is any, but not working yet, than the connection will tries later during the regular functionality.

To be an active part of an ISIS peer-to-peer network it is important to register the service itself using the HED self-registration mechanism. For further Setting see the configuration placed to the configuration templates in the documentation.

Sample ISIS service configuration:
    <Service name="isis" id="isis1">
        <!-- DBPath: File location where the database is physically stored -->
        <DBPath>/storage/arc1/isis1</DBPath>
        <!-- endpoint: The URL where the service can be accessed from outside -->
        <infosys:endpoint>http://knowarc2.grid.niif.hu:50000/isis1</infosys:endpoint>
        <!-- InfoProviderISIS: Contact details to one or more ISIS where the other
            ISIS's can be queried. -->
        <InfoProviderISIS>
            <URL>http://knowarc3.grid.niif.hu:50000/isis1</URL>
        </InfoProviderISIS>
        <!-- This element explicitly sais that the service have not to be registered.
            It has the same effect then the missing InfoRegister element. -->
        <infosys:NoRegister />
    </Service>
