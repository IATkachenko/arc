ISIS installation and configuration instructions

This directory contains the Information System Indexing Service (ISIS) 
regarding the next generation ARC information system.


I. Installation

In order to install ISIS please download and compile the full ARC HED:
	http://svn.nordugrid.org

Please read installation notes available there.


II. ISIS dependencies

a) Berkeley XML
Since the service uses Berkley XML database for storing the information 
received from the services or other ISIS nodes this package is a necessary 
dependency. 

b) Database directory
There is also a directory needed, where the directory containing the 
database will be stored. For example in the sample configuration contains 
the DBPath attribute as "/storage/arc1/isis1" where "/storage/arc1" have 
to exists before initializing the service.


III. ISIS endpoint reference

The service has to know its own endpoint address. Clients can access
ISIS via this address. Do not use local addresses in this attribute!


IV. InfoProvider nodes reference

The list of InfoProviderISIS elements contain ISIS nodes that are already 
connected to the peer-to-peer network at a high probability. If there 
is no such ISIS defined than the current one will initialize a new ISIS 
network. If there is any, but not working yet, then the entering ISIS
attempts to establish connection later during its regular operation.

To be an active part of an ISIS peer-to-peer network it is important to 
register the service itself using the HED self-registration mechanism. 
For further Setting see the configuration placed to the configuration 
templates in the documentation.


V. Sample ISIS configuration

Sample ISIS service configuration:
    <Service name="isis" id="isis1">
        <!-- DBPath: File location where the database is physically stored -->
        <DBPath>/storage/arc1/isis1</DBPath>
        <!-- endpoint: The URL where the service can be accessed from outside -->
        <infosys:endpoint>http://knowarc2.grid.niif.hu:50000/isis1</infosys:endpoint>
        <!-- InfoProviderISIS: Contact details to one or more ISIS where the other
            ISIS's can be queried. -->
        <InfoProviderISIS>
            <URL>http://knowarc3.grid.niif.hu:50000/isis1</URL>
        </InfoProviderISIS>
        <!-- This element explicitly says that the service have not to be registered.
            It has the same effect then the missing InfoRegister element. -->
        <infosys:NoRegister />
    </Service>
