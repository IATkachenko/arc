* Fri Jan 24 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- From Owen Synge <o.m.synge@rl.ac.uk>: add 
  C++-friendly ifdefs to gacl.h
* Tue Dec 2 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- Add GACLtestDNList() to handle checking of
  EDG VO LDAP groups and other DN-list based groups
  with some kind of URL-based name.
* Tue Dec 2 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- ==== Start GACL version 0.1.5 ====
* Tue Dec 3 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- Change GACLcred internal representation, to use
  a linked list of name/value pairs rather than
  specific, named fields in the struct; and to
  represent the credential type as a string, rather
  than an integer constant per type.
- Change GACLnewCred() and add GACLaddToCred() to
  reflect above changes. This allows credentials
  of (almost) arbitrary complexity to be handled 
  without modification to the code.
- Remove GACLtestCredAcl() - GACLtestUserAcl 
  provides the same functionality.
* Mon Dec 2 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- ==== Start GACL version 0.1.4 ====

  GACLfreeUser() and GACLfindCredInUser()

  rather than single user.dn element.
- Add handling of VOMS and CAS credential types.
* Fri Oct 11 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- Add GACL_TYPE_VOMS and .org and .role properties
  of GACLcred's in preparation for EDG VOMS support.
- Large updates to release notes in notes.html
* Wed Oct 9 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- Add GACLinit() which must be called before using
  GACL (initialises libxml thread safety etc.)
- Change includes for libxml2 <libxml/*> and use
  xml2-config --cflags to generate gcc -I option.
  (checked with libxml2-2.4.22)
* Sat Oct 5 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>
- Handle user.dn == NULL safely. 
* Sat Oct 5 2002 Andrew McNab <mcnab@hep.man.ac.uk>

  just .gacl, in anticipation of per-file ACL handling.
