.SH NAME

arc-infoindex-relay \- ARC Information Index Relay Helper

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B arc-infoindex-relay
command is used internally by the ARC Information System to relay queries
and responses between the slapd server and the arc-infoindex-server

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B arc-infoindex-relay
.I server-fifo

.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP "\fBserver-fifo\fR"
The FIFO on which the arc-infoindex-server accepts queries
.LP

.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

\fBarc-infoindex-relay\fR acts as a bridge between the slapd server
and the arc-infoindex-server in the NorduGrid ARC Information
system. For each index served by the arc-infoindex-server a shell
backend database should be configured in the slapd configuration.

Here is a sample configuration:

.nf
database  shell
suffix    "Mds-Vo-name=Sweden,o=Grid"
bind      /usr/sbin/arc-infoindex-relay /var/run/arc/infosys/giis-fifo
add       /usr/sbin/arc-infoindex-relay /var/run/arc/infosys/giis-fifo
search    /usr/sbin/arc-infoindex-relay /var/run/arc/infosys/giis-fifo
access to * by * write
.fi

When a query for the configured database is received by the slapd
server, the server will call out to the arc-infoindex-relay. The
arc-infoindex-relay will then open a unique return FIFO for this query
and then forward the query and the name of the return FIFO to the
arc-infoindex-server through the configured server FIFO. When the
arc-infoindex-server has processed the query it will return the result
to the arc-infoindex-relay using the return FIFO. The
arc-infoindex-relay then closes the return FIFO and forwards the
response to the slapd server.
