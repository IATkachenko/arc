NorduGrid ARC version @VERSION@

Grid Monitor
============


Description
-----------

Set of PHP scripts, providing a Web interface to the NorduGrid
Information System. Should be working for any similar LDAP-based
service, if the schema configuration is done carefuly.

The directory contains:

cache          - directory for front page cache
includes       - directory with common methods and configuration file (settings.inc)
lang           - directory with localizations
man            - directory for the man page
mon-icons      - directory with icons

allusers.php   - list grid users
attlist.php    - show values of selected attributes on the grid
clusdes.php    - show cluster or storage information
discover.php   - list attributes specific for an object for consecutive search
ws-monitor.in  - lynx call for the monitor (template)
help.php       - print help
jobstat.php    - show running/other jobs in a queue
loadmon.php    - main grid monitor script
Makefile.am    - Makefile template
monitor.js     - Java script for pop-up screens
mylo.js        - Java script for mail addresses
quelist.php    - show queue details and jobs
README.in      - README file (template)
sestat.php     - list storage elements
userlist.php   - show allowed sites and list of jobs of a user
volist.php     - static list of some VOs
vo-users.php   - lists users in a VO


Requirements
------------

- GD library (http://www.boutell.com/gd/)
- LDAP library (e.g., http://www.openldap.org)
- PHP4 or PHP5 (http://www.php.net) compiled with LDAP and GD extensions
- HTTP server compiled with PHP4 or PHP5
- Working ARC information system instance or a similar LDAP-based service
- Optional: running Virtual Organisation LDAP-based service


Installation
------------

1. Copy all the files in a folder, accessible by the HTTP server

2. Verify that this folder contains a directory called "cache" and
   that it is writeable by the HTTP server. If your server is configured
   to have write access only to a specific location, such as "../htdata",
   modify CACHE_LOCATION value in "includes/settings.inc" accordingly

3. Modify "includes/settings.inc" according to your infosystem
   structure and liking: most likely, you want to modify the $giislist
   array by removing some GIISes/GRISes and adding other(s)

4. Run the whole stuff by loading "loadmon.php" into your browser

Fine tuning
-----------

- Making output more human-readable: modify "/lang/*.inc", 
  "includes/cnvname.inc", "includes/cnvalias.inc". 

- Preventing sites from being polled: modify
  "includes/blacklist.inc". Otherwise, the file is not needed.
