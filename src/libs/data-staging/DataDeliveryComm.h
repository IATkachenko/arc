   * Different implementations provide different ways of providing Delivery
   * functionality. DataDeliveryLocalComm launches a local process to perform
   * the transfer and DataDeliveryRemoteComm contacts a remote service which
   * performs the transfer. The implementation is chosen depending on what is
   * set in the DTR, which the Scheduler should set based on various factors.
   *
   * CreateInstance() should be used to get a pointer to the instantiated
   * object. This also starts the transfer. Deleting this object stops the
   * transfer and cleans up any used resources. A singleton instance of
   * DataDeliveryCommHandler regularly polls all active transfers using
   * PullStatus() and fills the Status object with current information,
   * which can be obtained through GetStatus().
